        <h1><a href="">The CPU Kerfuffle Non-Canon Curiosity Tournament</a></h1>

        <p class="text">
            The following is a stripped down version of the first Non-Canon CPUK Tournament organized by Ryan in the official Chongoshow Discord. This tournament was broadcast over text, with only select matches streamed through voice chat. Extraneous comments and audience chatter have been left out. Additionally, each match result was preceded by a message along the lines of &quot;we have a report from the field&quot;&mdash; these have also been excluded due to redundancy, with a few exceptions where relevant.
        </p>
        <p class="text">
            Comments in parentheses () are not part of the original tournament text. They have been added to explain context that couldn&#39;t be expressed just through copy-pasted messages.
