            <p class="ryan">Explanation for anyone who wants to know <span class="spoiler">basically during the start of HS, Aradia, one of the characters, is a ghost because she was killed by the <s>best character</s> her bf who was under mind control. Her vibe is somewhat similar. Megalovania is in Homestuck and while it's widely considered to be Vriskas theme by idiots, a common idea is that it is the theme of Aradia after she ascends and is no longer a ghost, becoming the second/third best character depending on how I'm feeling</span></p>

            <p class="text">It was a late night for some, but for the single father of this household, there was much to do tonight still. Or so he imagined. But for Nera, it was bedtime.</p>

            <p class="text">She was already tucked in, and her father was  just about to leave when he felt a light tugging on his sleeve. "Daddy.......can you....tell me a bedtime story?"</p>

            <p class="text">He felt a pressure weigh upon him. Not by his daughter, who had heard plentiful bedtime stories at this point, but by....something else. That sensation......ever since the first time he ran through <span class="note">the machine</span>................where......when was he? <span class="note">"Of course, pastrycakes!"</span></p>

            <p class="text">These days, he could recite these stories without the need for books. Could books write the stories he knew about? <span class="note">"So....this is the story of a silly guy......"</span></p>

            <p class="text">The two erupted with laughter and glee as Nera's father watched over his daughter, happy to see her safe. "Ooh! Ooh! Daddy! Daddy! What was the evil Doctor's name?"</p>

            <p class="text">His laughter stopped immediately. <span class="note">"What do you mean?"</span></p>

            <p class="text">"Come on, daddy! They weren't just Doctor, right? They gotta have a name!!!!"</p>
