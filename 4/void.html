            <p class="text">"What do you mean?"</p>
            <p class="ryan text">This is the question that stumps Prism</p>
            <p class="text">"And why does it stump her?"</p>
            <p class="ryan text">Because I have no set motivation for her. Everything she's doing is kinda aimless, I guess. I make it pretty transparent that the amount of planning going into these things are minimal at BEST. CPU Kerfuffle isn't your average story. We retcon like mofos. Half the shit in this is made up on the fly. The only thing that was planned out was the Home twist, and that was only planned out two episodes before the reveal</p>
            <p class="text">"So you have no plans for us? You just change our past whenever you feel like it?'</p>
            <p class="ryan text">yes</p>

            <p class="ryan text">Hey, Jack.</p>
            <p class="text">"What is it?"</p>
            <p class="ryan text">I'm curious about something....how do you feel about the whole....Spectrum thing?</p>
            <p class="text">"I'm...not sure what you mean"</p>
            <p class="ryan text">Well before I did this whole thing, you were just a guy who lived in the tundra, joined a village, and could inexplicably speak through chat. But now there's a reason....because you saw Spectrum with your own eyes. And Spectrum gave you that weird power I guess.</p>
            <p class="text">"You guess???"</p>
            <p class="ryan text">Honestly, not even I know Spectrum's true power</p>
            <p class="text">"Didn't you CREATE Spectrum?"</p>
            <p class="ryan text">Yes and no</p>
            <p class="ryan text">I gave it a name and I gave it context to the story that you all reside in</p>
            <p class="ryan text">But Spectrum has existed for WAY longer than I have</p>
            <p class="text">"So what I saw was the raw form of some ethereal concept?"</p>
            <p class="ryan text">I guess so.</p>
            <p class="ryan text">I wouldn't know.</p>
            <p class="ryan text">I'm not the one who saw it.</p>
            <p class="ryan text">See, while there's a lot of benefit to being someone outside the universe of CPUK, there's still something I can sort of envy about you all, despite all of this control I have.</p>
            <p class="ryan text">I'll never see any of what we are acting out exist in a tangible sense, for better or for worse</p>
            <p class="text">"My free will has been ripped from my body in order to save someone who was suffering under something worse, how can you envy that?"</p>
            <p class="ryan text">Do you want me to list the reasons?</p>
            <p class="ryan text">1) In the WILD event that you don't come back from this victorious (which, come on) at the very least, your final moments were heroic. You did something that gave you meaning in helping someone else. At best, I die of old age at 89 after 50 years of whatever the hell I have coming next for me.</p>
            <p class="ryan text">2) Even if I wasn't writing this, it's clear you all are a story. You can reasonably assume that you're gonna get a happy ending through all this. End up victorious. Because even if it isn't me, 9 times out of 10, the person writing the story wants to create a happy ending for their story in some way shape or form. Or even if it isn't a happy one, some kind of closure.</p>
            <p class="ryan text">3) Everything here is so, so, SO simple. I even tried to make it more dramatic in this series, but even then, the sheer impact of some of the shit you all went through? Yeah, it's bad a lot of the time, but it sure as hell isn't as complex as my world</p>
            <p class="ryan text">I guess that's the crux of it all. One of the reasons people tell stories is a form of escapism from all of this madness. Jack, Cosmic, you've never had to worry about electricity bills, or making sure you make it to work on time every day or unreasonable bosses or  your dog getting mats in her fur or the county office giving you a citation because you're too exhausted to mow your lawn or the crippling loneliness of it all</p>
            <p class="ryan text">Yeah you get a cutscene. You get some focused emotions, and you have implications, but I honestly don't know.....do you feel it? The everyday grind? The feeling of having to go on and on and on and on every day until you die, without knowing if it's going to lead anywhere? Knowing that you have dreams, but having an idea instilled in your head to keep your dreams reasonable?</p>
            <p class="text">"....Dan does"</p>
            <p class="ryan text"><em><strong>AND WHY DO YOU THINK THE AUDIENCE LOVES HIM SO MUCH JACK????</strong></em></p>
            <p class="ryan text">I'm sorry</p>
            <p class="ryan text">Well I'm not, I know that I used bold, italics and capslock intentionally for dramatic effect</p>
            <p class="ryan text">Maybe this is why I'm always so hesitant to introduce this meta stuff.</p>
            <p class="ryan text">Because the relationship with a series, especially with so much improv and stream of consciousness, it's inevitable that the relationship between the work and its creator is explored.</p>
            <p class="ryan text">And......well........I'm going through it</p>
            <p class="ryan text">I'm still on the pathway to loving myself to the level I would like to</p>
            <p class="ryan text">I've improved, but</p>

            <p class="ryan text">Eventually it was revealed that this character could exist outside of the game. The big plot twist that never got fired off because of the beginning of my slump was gonna be that the character discovered that I'd projected all of my negative qualities onto them, making them essentially the bad version of me, I guess. Or like, me if only seen through a pessimistic perspective.</p>
            <p class="text">"So they still exist?"</p>
            <p class="ryan text">They'll always exist. Fortunately, at this point, I've been going to therapy for a while, and at the very least, they and I are on good terms. They like to cause trouble, and sometimes, especially when things get meta, they can come in and stir up trouble.</p>
            <p class="text">"But why????"</p>
            <p class="text">"Why would you let this evil version of yourself go to do awful things and ruin what you have?"</p>
            <p class="ryan text">Nothing wrong with a little conflict to spice up a story. Make it a little more exciting</p>
            <p class="text">"I LOST MY FREE WILL"</p>
            <p class="ryan text">And you'll get it back</p>
            <p class="ryan text">I can guarantee it beyond a shadow of a doubt</p>
            <p class="text">"Can you?"</p>
            <p class="text">"100 percent guarantee that I will be okay?"</p>
            <p class="ryan text">No, but I can't guarantee anything exactly 100%</p>
            <p class="text">"......what makes you different from Prism?"</p>
            <p class="ryan text">The fact that I felt every second of the ten minutes it took me to respond to you.</p>
            <p class="ryan text">Our realities run parallel at times, but they are completely unaligned.</p>
            <p class="ryan text">To anyone in my universe, you do not exist. To anyone in your universe, _**I**_ do not exist. Yes, we are the ones who create you, and we dictate your actions, but in a way, you dictate ours. You inspire us. We look upon your universe and see things that would be absolutely atrocious within our reality, but this veil between realities allows us pause.</p>
            <p class="ryan text">Jack, we all love you so much. We love all of you.</p>
            <p class="text">"In that case, why take my free will?"</p>

            <p class="ryan text">Sorry to be this blunt about it, Jack, but I figured you knew. This whole thing has been me talking to myself</p>
            <p class="text">"I.....think in the back of my mind.....I did, but......I suppose I once heard someone tell me.......nothing wrong with a little conflict"</p>
            <p class="ryan text">heh....now you're getting it.....</p>
            <p class="ryan text">So I guess to answer your question about what makes me different from Prism?</p>
            <p class="ryan text">Prism lives in your reality. I do not. Prism holds contempt whenever things don't go her way. I think it's important we learn to embrace it. Prism revels in the pain of others to feel vengeance. I like to think I use the pain so that we can process complicated emotions and trauma, because feeling something these days? Way better than bleak nothingness.</p>
            <p class="ryan text">Honestly? I still don't have my finger on it in full I don't think.</p>
            <p class="ryan text">I'm far far far from perfect. But I like to think that at the very least what I have plotted out is good in the end.</p>
            <p class="text">"And if it isn't?"</p>
            <p class="ryan text">Ask Waltz</p>
            <p class="text"><span class="void">                    i apologize for interrupting your soliloquy, but i believe they will be coming around quite soon                               </span></p>
            <p class="ryan text">Okay</p>
            <p class="ryan text">Jack</p>
            <p class="text">"Yeah?"</p>
            <p class="ryan text">Do you trust me?</p>
            <p class="text">"Do I have a choice?"</p>
            <p class="ryan text">That's a good question</p>
            <p class="ryan text">If I believe in a god, or some other higher being if you aren't religious, and I believe that he created me exactly the way I am down to every last brain cell, knowing exactly how I would develop.....who I would meet....what I would see.....what I'd experience.........</p>
            <p class="ryan text">If an all-knowing god knows all of that, then wouldn't that god know exactly what choice I would make?</p>
            <p class="ryan text">If we're going by that standard, you might have more of a choice than me. At least you have Smash Bros battles that I can't predict, hehe......</p>
            <p class="text">"Do you believe you have a choice then?"</p>
            <p class="ryan text">I don't know</p>
            <p class="ryan text">I just hope that I'm able to make other people happy.</p>
