            <p class="ryan text">As much as I love the idea I saw floated around that he's the same one as your father, you know at this point that isn't the case</p>

            <p class="text">"What?"</p>
            <p class="ryan text">I'm just coming up with ideas to make everything really sad, you know how it is</p>
            <p class="text">"So I have to know, Ryan......."</p>
            <p class="text">"Why....."</p>
            <p class="ryan text">.....I see what you're doing here</p>
            <p class="text">"What do you mean?"</p>
            <p class="ryan text">This is the question that stumps Prism</p>
            <p class="text">"And why does it stump her?"</p>
            <p class="ryan text">Because I have no set motivation for her. Everything she's doing is kinda aimless, I guess. I make it pretty transparent that the amount of planning going into these things are minimal at BEST. CPU Kerfuffle isn't your average story. We retcon like mofos. Half the shit in this is made up on the fly. The only thing that was planned out was the Home twist, and that was only planned out two episodes before the reveal</p>
            <p class="text">"So you have no plans for us? You just change our past whenever you feel like it?'</p>
            <p class="ryan text">yes</p>
            <p class="ryan text">Why am I even doing this?</p>
            <p class="text"><span class="void">                                                                                                                                likely because you are processing some heavy emotions             </span></p>
            <p class="ryan text">Cosmic, can we not???</p>
            <p class="text"><span class="void">           why do you ask me?                                       </span></p>
            <p class="ryan text">yeah good point.</p>
            <p class="ryan text">Just I'd rather not</p>
            <p class="text">"Turn this into a therapy session for yourself. Yeah, we've heard it over and over again."</p>
            <p class="text"><span class="void">                                                                                                 it is okay. we do not have to discuss your personal connection to the story in specific detail.......however, can we assume in broad strokes that it may be an answer as to why this continues? why i have so much more to who i am?                     </span></p>
            <p class="ryan text">......in some capacity I guess so....</p>
            <p class="text"><span class="void">                that is all i wish to know                                    </span></p>
            <p class="ryan text">This was a bad idea</p>
            <p class="ryan text">Or maybe it was bad timing</p>
            <p class="ryan text">I dont know</p>
