            <p class="text"><em><span class="crimson">OH MY GOD ARE YOU SHITTING ME???????</span></em></p>

            <p class="text">".....and then Twilight realized, hold on a minute I can just ASK Princess Celestia for four more tickets to the Gra- Whoa! Hey! Crimson! Is that a Snake?"</p>

            <p class="text">Crimson froze hearing the question asked, breaking him out of whatever conversation with a void goddess his mind was mired in. "What....did you just say?" He turned around to see a familiar sight. It was another array of colors shining brightly and somehow sticking out from the other overwhelming colors, which signalled the end of another branch of the tourney. But out of this one came.....a snake....had he awoken?</p>

            <p class="text"><span class="prism">"Oh god,oh god oh god oh god oh fuck oh god he's free :)"</span> the possessed Dantoinette said, panic hidden by a chipper demeanor as the eight approached the portal that had appeared, ready for whatever may come out.</p>

            <p class="text">The first thing to exit from the portal was Captain Quadratic, charging out, as if fearing for his life, tripping on the floor and rolling around by the feet of the others. "WHAT IN GODS NAME IS THAT THING????" he shouted as the sight of small serpents began to leak out of the portal.  The snakes had found its way into the story. And it had found the source. The epicenter.</p>

            <p class="text">And there weren't 10 people that any of them could forward the email to.</p>

            <p class="text">Juniper looked up at Crimson with a worried look in her eyes. "Crimbo? What....what is that?"</p>

            <p class="text">Crimson closed his eyes, gulping. "That's the Lord of the Snakes. No one knows where he came from. No one knows what he wants. No one knows why he exists. All that they know is that he is mindless.....he is virulent.....he is a force of destruction that none of us are even close to prepared for.....he's the end of everything."</p>

            <p class="text">Cobalt nodded softly as he looks over to his brother. "Crimson, get ahold of yourself. There are nine of us....and one of whatever this thing is. I understand that it is a fright, but I believe we can handle it. We MUST handle it."</p>

            <p class="text">As if responding to Cobalt's statement, the scene changed. At first it appears to be a cavalcade of countless snakes, most latching themselves to the side of the portal. To estimate the quantity of snakes in the thousands would be a conservative estimate. But other snakes erupted from the portal as makeshift small ropes. One of these ropes found itself wrapped around Cobalt's leg, tugging him to the ground, allowing more snake ropes to more easily restrain him. Shouts of shock echoed across the over stimulating space as Captain Crimson, Spriteman, Folk, Brunette Roxas, and Captain Quadratic were restrained as well.</p>

            <p class="text">But, the true horror came when they found out why there were so many snakes latching onto the edges of the portal.</p>

            <p class="text">They were dragging something through it.</p>

            <p class="text">A hulking, slithering mass, seeming to be made up entirely of millions of snakes, burst out of the portal, creating the form of what looked to be an enormous snake, seemingly stretching the bounds of the portal itself with its consistently slithering, bulking mass, with a pair of divots in the front creating the illusion of a pair of eyes. It let out a guttural roar that shook everyone, restrained or unrestrained.</p>

            <p class="text">"Crimson?" Juniper's voice shook as she tried to ask what this devilish beast even was.</p>

            <p class="prism text">"The Lord of Snakes :)"</p>

            <p class="text">"....what?"</p>

            <p class="prism text">"I knew it would be time sooner or later and that he would be done with us soon, but I thought that maybe he would at least finish this dream :)"</p>

            <p class="text">Crimson looked up at Prism in shock. Crimson knew about the Lord of Snakes, but what did Prism know? "Prism?? How the hell do you know about this guy?"</p>

            <p class="text">Dantoinette looks back at Crimson with....tears in her eyes.</p>

            <p class="prism text">"This is something I've tried to put off, but it was bound to happen :)"</p>

            <p class="text">Of course. "What??? Are you telling me???"</p>

            <p class="prism text">"Yes :) The story you've been told is another abstraction :) This will eat our universe as suddenly as it will swiftly :) And it's simply out of our control, no matter how hard I tried to keep it away :)"</p>

            <p class="text">Juniper swings her axe at a snake rope coming in. "What does she mean, Crimson?"</p>

            <p class="text">Crimson turns his hat to the side dramatically as he gives a long sigh. These are probably his final moments. He better make them count.</p>

            <p class="text">"Kid....CPU Kerfuffle might just be over." She wouldn't know what that meant. And that wasn't fair for Juniper. But most things are unfair. Especially with the god of balance incapacitated.</p>

            <p class="text">That's when he felt it. A snake clenching itself around his goopy leg before he could finish what he had wanted to say. Before he could react, Crimson feels himself flying into the air and careening faster than his mind could register towards the amalgam of snakes.</p>

            <p class="prism text">I watched him be consumed :)</p>

            <p class="prism text">It.......Oh my god....It's just me and Juniper....:)</p>

            <p class="prism text">Juniper is looking up at me right now, scared out of her mind :)</p>

            <p class="prism text">I know that I've made her feel that way.....I know the pain I've caused.... :)</p>

            <p class="prism text">I know how hurt she must be........it reminds me of Crimson.....:)</p>

            <p class="prism text">............I wish that I had one more chance to talk to Crimson :)</p>

            <p class="prism text">So I could tell him I'm sorry :)</p>

            <p class="prism text">Thinking about the pain I've caused him......caused her..... :)</p>

            <p class="prism text">It hurts me......every time.....:)</p>

            <p class="prism text">I just thought......maybe we could keep it going for just a little longer :)</p>

            <p class="prism text">We could have some more fun with Larry.........and Dani.....and Juniper.....Crimson.....:)</p>

            <p class="prism text">But when fear takes over...........I suppose I......went to a darker place :)</p>

            <p class="prism text">If you don't forgive me for this....I understand. :)</p>

            <p class="prism text">But, from the bottom of my heart, I want to say. :)</p>

            <p class="prism text">I'm sorry :)</p>

            <p class="prism text">I'm so....so sorry for everything :)</p>

            <p class="text">.................................</p>

            <p class="text">...................................................</p>

            <p class="text">.....................................................</p>

            <p class="text">................................................</p>

            <p class="text">Juniper Uppercut watches between axe swings as the rainbow-colored Dantoinette is absorbed by snakes.</p>

            <p class="text">She is alone again.</p>

            <p class="text">What does she do?</p>

            <p class="text">........</p>

            <p class="text">She plants her foot in the ground, holding her axe, fresh with the blood of tens of snakes already.</p>

            <p class="text">Maybe.......it can work on one big snake.</p>

            <p class="text">Juniper closes her eyes, imagining the voice of Alabaster echoing into her head a word of encouragement before her eyes flare open and she charges at the best, leaping axe first into the nightmare amalgam in this strange world, a cry of life blasting out from her.</p>

            <p class="text">If only such a spirit would be so effective.</p>

            <p class="text">As she makes contact, the snakes envelop her immediately, swarming over her. "No!" She shouts, hoping for someone to hear her, even though no one is there.</p>

            <p class="text">"NO!!!!" she repeats as the snakes envelop her form. The last thing she sees before going under completely is the same thing happening to all of her friends from Dantoinette to Crimson to Cobalt. Everyone is being absorbed.</p>

            <p class="text"><em>NO!!!</em> she can't say anything, too covered by snakes. All that she has is her despair. It was over.</p>

            <p class="text"><em>......no..........</em> This beast was too powerful. A beast of pure dysfunction. A beast the feeds upon what is incomplete. A beast that feeds upon potential unrealized. Spectrum's creations which do not fully manifest. And it seems that she is next......when she feels a hand grab a hold of hers.......</p>

            <p class="text"><em>.............n............yes?..........</em></p>

            <p class="text">The hand yanks Juniper all of a sudden as a newfound sense of vigor flows through her body through this new hand . The thoughts only came back stronger.</p>

            <p class="text"><em>Yes......</em></p>

            <p class="text">A shining light seemed to shine from Juniper as she was dragged through the countless mass of snakes, a feeling of power coursing through her veins like she just ate a hundred pixie stix.</p>

            <p class="text"><em>Yes!</em></p>

            <p class="text">Suddenly, Juniper is jerked airborne as the hand that holds her jumps high into the sky, taking the young girl with her.</p>

            <p class="text"><em>YES!!!!!!</em></p>

            <p class="text">From up above everything, the entire world is still very overwhelming, but the dark and miserable snake colossus stands out like a sore thumb. She can see that she's right on top of it, all it was going to take was a little boost, which the hand that held her was willing to provide, saying exactly what Juniper was thinking.</p>

            <p class="text">The sound started as a low hum</p>

            <p class="text">And only grew louder</p>

            <p class="justice text">"mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmMMMMMMMMMYYYYYYYYYYYEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEESSSSSSSSSSSSSSS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"</p>

            <p class="text">With that shout, Juniper goes careening at an unfathomable speed toward the giant snake. She keeps her composure against the blistering wind on her face to lead with the axe.</p>

            <p class="justice text">"YYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEHHHHHHHHHHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW!!!"</p>

            <p class="text">The collision feels like it's in slow motion.</p>

            <p class="text">The axe shines with the light of balance.</p>

            <p class="text">The light of tragedy.</p>

            <p class="text">The light of treachery.</p>

            <p class="text">The light of imagination.</p>

            <p class="text">The light of love.</p>

            <p class="text">The light of power.</p>

            <p class="text">The light of triumph.</p>

            <p class="text">The light of laughter.</p>

            <p class="text">The light of pride.</p>

            <p class="text">The light of beauty.</p>

            <p class="text">The light of sorrow.</p>

            <p class="text">The light of ideas.</p>

            <p class="text">The light of rage.</p>

            <p class="text">The light of inspiration.</p>

            <p class="text">The light of justice.</p>

            <p class="text">The light of <span class="white">Spectrum</span>.</p>

            <p class="text">As if a magic spell had been cast, there is a blinding flash of light, and an animalistic roar of pain......and with that.....the beast is no more......</p>

            <p class="prism text">Hah! Haha!!!!! I'm alive!!!!!! :) What the hell just happened?! :)</p>

            <p class="prism text">There were snakes, it was all about to end, but now it's.....not there anymore....? :)</p>

            <p class="prism text">I blacked out for a bit, but- Is that....Painguin? :) ....on the other side of the portal? :)</p>

            <p class="prism text">Wait a minute, is that....that's Trainer of Justice! :)</p>

            <p class="prism text">Did.....did he save us?</p>

            <p class="prism text">Wait....he's.....he's approaching me..... :)</p>

            <p class="prism text">I.....is he......is he offering me forgiveness? :)</p>
