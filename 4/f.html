            <p class="text"><em><span class="crimson">OH MY GOD ARE YOU SHITTING ME???????</span></em></p>

            <p class="text">".....and then Twilight realized, hold on a minute I can just ASK Princess Celestia for four more tickets to the Gra- Whoa! Hey! Crimson! Is that a Snake?"</p>

            <p class="text">Crimson froze hearing the question asked, breaking him out of whatever conversation with a void goddess his mind was mired in. "What....did you just say?" He turned around to see a familiar sight. It was another array of colors shining brightly and somehow sticking out from the other overwhelming colors, which signalled the end of another branch of the tourney. But out of this one came.....a snake....had he awoken?</p>

            <p class="text"><span class="prism">"Oh god,oh god oh god oh god oh fuck oh god he's free :)"</span> the possessed Dantoinette said, panic hidden by a chipper demeanor as the eight approached the portal that had appeared, ready for whatever may come out.</p>

            <p class="text">The first thing to exit from the portal was Captain Quadratic, charging out, as if fearing for his life, tripping on the floor and rolling around by the feet of the others. "WHAT IN GODS NAME IS THAT THING????" he shouted as the sight of small serpents began to leak out of the portal.  The snakes had found its way into the story. And it had found the source. The epicenter.</p>

            <p class="text">And there weren't 10 people that any of them could forward the email to.</p>

            <p class="text">Juniper looked up at Crimson with a worried look in her eyes. "Crimbo? What....what is that?"</p>

            <p class="text">Crimson closed his eyes, gulping. "That's the Lord of the Snakes. No one knows where he came from. No one knows what he wants. No one knows why he exists. All that they know is that he is mindless.....he is virulent.....he is a force of destruction that none of us are even close to prepared for.....he's the end of everything."</p>

            <p class="text">Cobalt nodded softly as he looks over to his brother. "Crimson, get ahold of yourself. There are nine of us....and one of whatever this thing is. I understand that it is a fright, but I believe we can handle it. We MUST handle it."</p>

            <p class="text">As if responding to Cobalt's statement, the scene changed. At first it appears to be a cavalcade of countless snakes, most latching themselves to the side of the portal. To estimate the quantity of snakes in the thousands would be a conservative estimate. But other snakes erupted from the portal as makeshift small ropes. One of these ropes found itself wrapped around Cobalt's leg, tugging him to the ground, allowing more snake ropes to more easily restrain him. Shouts of shock echoed across the over stimulating space as Captain Crimson, Spriteman, Folk, Brunette Roxas, and Captain Quadratic were restrained as well.</p>

            <p class="text">But, the true horror came when they found out why there were so many snakes latching onto the edges of the portal.</p>

            <p class="text">They were dragging something through it.</p>

            <p class="text">A hulking, slithering mass, seeming to be made up entirely of millions of snakes, burst out of the portal, creating the form of what looked to be an enormous snake, seemingly stretching the bounds of the portal itself with its consistently slithering, bulking mass, with a pair of divots in the front creating the illusion of a pair of eyes. It let out a guttural roar that shook everyone, restrained or unrestrained.</p>

            <p class="text">"Crimson?" Juniper's voice shook as she tried to ask what this devilish beast even was.</p>

            <p class="prism text">"The Lord of Snakes :)"</p>

            <p class="text">"....what?"</p>

            <p class="prism text">"I knew it would be time sooner or later and that he would be done with us soon, but I thought that maybe he would at least finish this dream :)"</p>

            <p class="text">Crimson looked up at Prism in shock. Crimson knew about the Lord of Snakes, but what did Prism know? "Prism?? How the hell do you know about this guy?"</p>

            <p class="text">Dantoinette looks back at Crimson with....tears in her eyes.</p>

            <p class="prism text">"This is something I've tried to put off, but it was bound to happen :)"</p>

            <p class="text">Of course. "What??? Are you telling me???"</p>

            <p class="prism text">"Yes :) The story you've been told is another abstraction :) This will eat our universe as suddenly as it will swiftly :) And it's simply out of our control, no matter how hard I tried to keep it away :)"</p>

            <p class="text">Juniper swings her axe at a snake rope coming in. "What does she mean, Crimson?"</p>

            <p class="text">Crimson turns his hat to the side dramatically as he gives a long sigh. These are probably his final moments. He better make them count.</p>

            <p class="text">"Kid....CPU Kerfuffle might just be over." She wouldn't know what that meant. And that wasn't fair for Juniper. But most things are unfair. Especially with the god of balance incapacitated.</p>

            <p class="text">That's when he felt it. A snake clenching itself around his goopy leg before he could finish what he had wanted to say. Before he could react, Crimson feels himself flying into the air and careening faster than his mind could register towards the amalgam of snakes.</p>

            <p class="prism text">I watched him be consumed :)</p>

            <p class="prism text">It.......Oh my god....It's just me and Juniper....:)</p>

            <p class="prism text">Juniper is looking up at me right now, scared out of her mind :)</p>

            <p class="prism text">I know that I've made her feel that way.....I know the pain I've caused.... :)</p>

            <p class="prism text">I know how hurt she must be........it reminds me of Crimson.....:)</p>

            <p class="prism text">............I wish that I had one more chance to talk to Crimson :)</p>

            <p class="prism text">So I could tell him I'm sorry :)</p>

            <p class="prism text">Thinking about the pain I've caused him......caused her..... :)</p>

            <p class="prism text">It hurts me......every time.....:)</p>

            <p class="prism text">I just thought......maybe we could keep it going for just a little longer :)</p>

            <p class="prism text">We could have some more fun with Larry.........and Dani.....and Juniper.....Crimson.....:)</p>

            <p class="prism text">But when fear takes over...........I suppose I......went to a darker place :)</p>

            <p class="prism text">If you don't forgive me for this....I understand. :)</p>

            <p class="prism text">But, from the bottom of my heart, I want to say. :)</p>

            <p class="prism text">I'm sorry :)</p>

            <p class="prism text">I'm so....so sorry for everything :)</p>

            <p class="text">.................................</p>

            <p class="text">...................................................</p>

            <p class="text">.....................................................</p>

            <p class="text">................................................</p>

            <p class="text">Juniper Uppercut watches between axe swings as the rainbow-colored Dantoinette is absorbed by snakes.</p>

            <p class="text">She is alone again.</p>

            <p class="text">What does she do?</p>

            <p class="text">........</p>

            <p class="text">She plants her foot in the ground, holding her axe, fresh with the blood of tens of snakes already.</p>

            <p class="text">Maybe.......it can work on one big snake.</p>

            <p class="text">Juniper closes her eyes, imagining the voice of Alabaster echoing into her head a word of encouragement before her eyes flare open and she charges at the best, leaping axe first into the nightmare amalgam in this strange world, a cry of life blasting out from her.</p>

            <p class="text">If only such a spirit would be so effective.</p>

            <p class="text">As she makes contact, the snakes envelop her immediately, swarming over her. "No!" She shouts, hoping for someone to hear her, even though no one is there.</p>

            <p class="text">"NO!!!!" she repeats as the snakes envelop her form. The last thing she sees before going under completely is the same thing happening to all of her friends from Dantoinette to Crimson to Cobalt. Everyone is being absorbed.</p>

            <p class="text"><em>NO!!!</em> she can't say anything, too covered by snakes. All that she has is her despair. It was over.</p>

            <p class="text"><em>......no..........</em> This beast was too powerful. A beast of pure dysfunction. A beast the feeds upon what is incomplete. A beast that feeds upon potential unrealized. Spectrum's creations which do not fully manifest. And it seems that she is next......when she feels a hand grab a hold of hers.......</p>

            <p class="text"><em>.............n............yes?..........</em></p>

            <p class="text">The hand yanks Juniper all of a sudden as a newfound sense of vigor flows through her body through this new hand . The thoughts only came back stronger.</p>

            <p class="text"><em>Yes......</em></p>

            <p class="text">A shining light seemed to shine from Juniper as she was dragged through the countless mass of snakes, a feeling of power coursing through her veins like she just ate a hundred pixie stix.</p>

            <p class="text"><em>Yes!</em></p>

            <p class="text">Suddenly, Juniper is jerked airborne as the hand that holds her jumps high into the sky, taking the young girl with her.</p>

            <p class="text"><em>YES!!!!!!</em></p>

            <p class="text">From up above everything, the entire world is still very overwhelming, but the dark and miserable snake colossus stands out like a sore thumb. She can see that she's right on top of it, all it was going to take was a little boost, which the hand that held her was willing to provide, saying exactly what Juniper was thinking.</p>

            <p class="text">The sound started as a low hum</p>

            <p class="text">And only grew louder</p>

            <p class="justice text">"mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmMMMMMMMMMYYYYYYYYYYYEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEESSSSSSSSSSSSSSS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"</p>

            <p class="text">With that shout, Juniper goes careening at an unfathomable speed toward the giant snake. She keeps her composure against the blistering wind on her face to lead with the axe.</p>

            <p class="justice text">"YYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEHHHHHHHHHHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW!!!"</p>

            <p class="text">The collision feels like it's in slow motion.</p>

            <p class="text">The axe shines with the light of balance.</p>

            <p class="text">The light of tragedy.</p>

            <p class="text">The light of treachery.</p>

            <p class="text">The light of imagination.</p>

            <p class="text">The light of love.</p>

            <p class="text">The light of power.</p>

            <p class="text">The light of triumph.</p>

            <p class="text">The light of laughter.</p>

            <p class="text">The light of pride.</p>

            <p class="text">The light of beauty.</p>

            <p class="text">The light of sorrow.</p>

            <p class="text">The light of ideas.</p>

            <p class="text">The light of rage.</p>

            <p class="text">The light of inspiration.</p>

            <p class="text">The light of justice.</p>

            <p class="text">The light of <span class="white">Spectrum</span>.</p>

            <p class="text">As if a magic spell had been cast, there is a blinding flash of light, and an animalistic roar of pain......and with that.....the beast is no more......</p>

            <p class="prism text">Hah! Haha!!!!! I'm alive!!!!!! :) What the hell just happened?! :)</p>

            <p class="prism text">There were snakes, it was all about to end, but now it's.....not there anymore....? :)</p>

            <p class="prism text">I blacked out for a bit, but- Is that....Painguin? :) ....on the other side of the portal? :)</p>

            <p class="prism text">Wait a minute, is that....that's Trainer of Justice! :)</p>

            <p class="prism text">Did.....did he save us?</p>

            <p class="text"><span class="prism">Suddenly a rogue thought appeared in her head :)</span></p>

            <p class="text"><span class="prism">A voice came from behind Prismatic Dani, speaking almost simultaneously with the voice in her head, almost leading her to not even notice it. :) When she turned around, she saw that it was the rugged dog himself, Folk. :) Now what on earth was he about to chew her out for? :)</span></p>
            <p class="text"><span class="prism">"I see that look in your eye, Folk! :) I'm assuming since Therapuppy got some memories back, maybe you did, too? :) You're not too traumatized, are-"</span></p>
            <p class="text">"That ain't what I'm here for, Prism," <span class="prism">his voice seemed calm and...almost gentle. :)</span> "I DID get some memories back, but I'm here to pick up where my past self left off.

Even older than Crimson and Treusey?"</p>
            <p class="text"><span class="prism">"Yep! I've existed for all time! :) Even before time, predating your lovely lady :)"</span></p>

            <p class="text">"I'm sorry if I'm prying, but...sounds rough, huh? Living an eternity in a world you know is doomed to die?"</p>
            <p class="text">Prismatic Dani shifted somewhat uncomfortably, keeping the smile on her face no matter what. <span class="prism">"It's not too rough. :) You just take it day by day. :) When I was helping to form everything, I didn't think about the fact it would all end. :) The only thing that was important is that it would make a good story. :)"</span></p>
            <p class="text"><em>"So what was my ending, Prism?"</em></p>

            <p class="text"><em>"If you Sopranos me, I swear to god..."</em></p>
            <p class="text">"A good story, huh?" Folk paused for a moment, tapping his fingers on the invisible floor, creating a silent tapping motion. "So while you were building all of this, did you have an idea for a sort of...ideal state of being? Like, you'd wake up one morning and think 'You know what? I'm happy!'. Did you ever have that?"</p>
            <p class="text"><span class="prism">Prism nodded enthusiastically :) "It was all very vague since there are plenty of elements that you all like to do outside my control, but it was fantastic! The great evils defeated, perhaps a grand heroic sacrifice, maybe a fun little scene of Squid Jenny asking Vampire Catgirl Tifa out.

            <p class="text">"Me? Well, I know before everything went down, I always imagined I would settle down, maybe meet someone, and spend my days helping people through all their own problems. Maybe at the end of the day I'd go out on a porch with some peach tea. Watch the sunset. After everything's gone down, including the whole Doctor Order apocalypse fiasco, I guess it's about the same."</p>

            <p class="text"><span class="prism">".............................I envy you, Folk :)"</span> Tears streamed past her wide smile.</p>
            <p class="text">Folk slowly stood up, detecting he'd gotten somewhere, but to press harder might be a bit too much emotional pressure. "Do...you want me to stick around?"</p>
            <p class="text"><span class="prism">"No thank you :)"</span></p>
            <p class="text">".....alright, just...just remember that despite everything you've done...despite the pain you've caused....despite all the wrongdoings.....and despite the consequences you deserve to face for them....you're still worthy of love, Prism. You deserve to love yourself."</p>
            <p class="text"><span class="prism">"I don't know how you can say that. :) I almost erased you from existence :). And all so that I could torment the one you love. :)"</span></p>

        <div class="cutscene-start"></div>
        <div class="cutscene">
            <p class="text">"Alright, next!" The shockingly mundane voice of the hydra's head boomed through the hall as a spirit of someone wicked nervously approached his desk.</p>
            <p class="text"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOhMmVeNd0M">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOhMmVeNd0M</a></p>
            <p class="text">"Um.....wh....where-"</p>
            <p class="text">"Name?" The light blue lizard's head asked nonchalantly without looking up from his sudoku puzzle.</p>
            <p class="text">He was on admissions today, which wasn't quite as bad as the usual paperwork that ╬╬╬╬╬╬╬╬ was tasked with today, but...ironically....Sauerkraut ended up being the lucky one today with overseeing eternal torment. Which, honestly, might have been good. He seemed to be in the dumps...well....more than he usually was...so venting out those emotions to the eternally damned might help in a way.</p>
            <p class="text">The cursed soul shifted his feet slightly. "U-um.....Richard...........Sibley? Where....am I? Why am I in these chains?"</p>
            <p class="text">Jonny didn't even look up from his Sudoku puzzle. How could he? He was so close to figuring out where the hell (no pun intended) to put this 5.</p>
            <p class="text">"Yeah, you're in hell. I dunno if you didn't put it together from the fire and brimstone or if you're still in denial about it, but yeah. The big S deemed you not worthy. Not my decision, I just watch over this place. No, there was not some kind of mistake. No, we do not accept games of chess, and even if we did, we have more experience than your brain could fathom, and your defeat is inevitable. Also, we do not accept deals, that's the balance guy's game. And finally, no there are no cute demon girls. Any more questions?"</p>
            <p class="text">Richard shook in his ethereal boots at the onslaught of new information he had received. "How....how did I die?"</p>
            <p class="text">"OH SHIT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"</p>
            <p class="text">The sudden outburst from the frigid dragon caused the judged spectre to jump. "Wh-what is it?" A look of hope spread across his face. Perhaps there WAS a mistake! Perhaps he wasn't damned to- "THATS where the 5 goes!" the dragon picks up his pencil with his mouth and expertly writes the number "5" in one of the Sudoku squares. Despite using his mouth, he had perfect handwriting.</p>
            <p class="text">"Oh yeah, and to answer your question, you were killed in your sleep after you wrote a blatantly racist law that severely restricted the rights of the Inuit population and spread propaganda to dehumanize them. The person who killed you was based." Jonny hit a button at his desk, immediately opening a trapdoor  to drop Richard into the depths.</p>
            <p class="text">"Next!!!!"</p>
            <p class="text">Suddenly, he felt a tugging from his other neck. It was ╬╬╬╬╬╬╬╬. These kinds of emergency Korioni head meetings were rare, even after the eternity they spent ruling together, so he responded immediately, retreating his head back through the passage behind the desk.</p>
            <p class="text">After retracting his head, he found himself in their room, dimly lit with torchlight to give it that rustic look, with the three holes standing in front of them. One leading to admissions, on leading to the office, and one leading to the damnation chamber. ╬╬╬╬╬╬╬╬ had already retracted his head from the treasury slot as his tugging had called this meeting, and Sauerkraut was still in the damnation chamber.</p>
            <p class="text">"Hey, hey, what's goin' on, ╬╬╬╬╬╬╬╬?"</p>
            <p class="text">╬╬╬╬╬╬╬╬ responded with his usual bluster. "Greetings, Jonny! I felt this meeting was absolutely integral to truly continue our reign over hell and continue to torment the wretched souls that plague the mortal coil and deliver the punishment they deserve!"</p>
            <p class="text">"Nifty, so, like, what's up tho?"</p>
            <p class="text">╬╬╬╬╬╬╬╬'s head reaches into the corner of the room to grab a scroll. "Well, I am certain you recall a few months ago when Spectrum's emissary arrived at the gates of hell for inspection, yes?"</p>
            <p class="text">Of course,  how could he forget? She was a pretty pleasant person, had an iconic smile, and she absolutely had the ability to overwrite literally anything that any of them said or thought, but save for that little hiccup, she seemed pretty chill. "Yeah, what about it?"</p>
            <p class="text">"Well, after ruminating within my chamber for days upon days, thinking back upon everything that she had said, I believe that-"</p>
            <p class="text">"-thaaaaat she was gonna shut us down. Yeah, I know you were kinda worried about that."</p>
            <p class="text">A cold mist emanated from ╬╬╬╬╬╬╬╬'s nostrils. "'Kind of worried?' Jonny, I understand that you are rather lackadaisical by nature, however I would imagine that you would take her statements far more seriously, especially as someone coming directly from Spectrum!"</p>
            <p class="text">"...oooohhhhhhhhhh, you don't know? Sorry, I thought it was common knowledge. This one's on me, ╬╬╬╬╬╬╬╬!"</p>
            <p class="text">"On you, what in th-"</p>

            <p class="text">╬╬╬╬╬╬╬╬ paused. "Her purpose is the narrative, then?"</p>
            <p class="text">Jonny nodded. "Yep, so we're fine. We dipped our heads in a little bit and gave clearance for a single narrative intrusion into our lives under the stipulation that our status quo be unaffected. In fact, I'd wager that right now is that moment. Smile for the camera."</p>
            <p class="text">"So then, why did the brightly colored menace threaten to take us down?"</p>
            <p class="text">"Pretty sure it was to get a rise out of Sauerkraut."</p>
            <p class="text">"Of course...however the source of her potential affinity for cruelty might be tied to the information I had found."</p>
            <p class="text">Jonny's attention was caught by this. "Ohoho, really? And what info did you find?"</p>
            <p class="text">"The narrative will end soon."</p>
            <p class="text">Jonny's attention was lost just as quickly, his mind going back to the numbers that floated around his Sudoku. "Oh, wow, it comes to an end, does it? Next you'll tell me that 2 plus 2 is 4 or that time is cyclical. I really don't see why this couldn't wait until the end of the shift, but to be fair, it's on me for not keeping you informed about Prism's purpose."</p>
            <p class="text">Jonny began to slither his way back to admissions, when he heard his other head speak once again "I wonder what it must feel like to hold immortal purpose over something that is definitively finite. Our purpose is to watch over hell. We have found comfort in our purpose. We live to fulfill the purpose. We do so successfully. And because of this we are content." Another pause. "What is the fate of this vestigial appendage of Spectrum? To exist without purpose..... To be forced to exist knowing that your purpose has been fulfilled? What drives one to awaken?"</p>
            <p class="text">Jonny stopped before entering. "That's....not really our problem. But she seems pretty good at tormenting people. It might not fit her predetermined purpose so who knows if she would feel any fulfillment from it, but we can check for openings if you really care about her."</p>
            <p class="text">"CARE? AS IF I COULD CARE FOR A BEING SUCH AS THIS" ╬╬╬╬╬╬╬╬ snapped back almost immediately. As if on cue, the third head of the hydra emerged from its hole.</p>
            <p class="text">"Hey guys, sorry I was late, I was getting bullied by one of the souls and I had to structure a tortue chamber bad enough for him to feel true pain, I didn't miss anything, did I?"</p>
            <p class="text">╬╬╬╬╬╬╬╬, still heated by Jonny's accusation shouted back, holding back slightly as to ensure it wasn't taken personally. "YES YOU DID SAUERKRAUT, YOU MISSED THE ENTIRE CONVERSATION"</p>
