            <p class="prism text">Dear Spectrum :)</p>
            <p class="prism text">I pray to you at this time of strife and this time of chaos :)</p>
            <p class="prism text">I humble myself to you, and look to you in my times of doubt :)</p>
            <p class="prism text">As I'm sure that you see, the situation looks to be perilous, but I know that through you, I will be able to not only survive, but thrive in the greater good of what you are :)</p>
            <p class="prism text">But......</p>
            <p class="prism text">I've found myself asking a question to myself......one that I hope that you would be able to help me with.......</p>
            <p class="prism text">Why?</p>
            <p class="prism text">You created me to be a part of these tournaments, and I very much enjoy being a part of them, but......I can't help but to wonder why you created me for this......</p>
            <p class="prism text">To be a villain? I understand that. And I believe that I have served such a purpose well....but what is the purpose of this world you have created?</p>
            <p class="prism text">This world....it's chaotic....and it's fun. But I can see.......ideas......and messages.....stories of people overcoming their own trauma.......</p>
            <p class="prism text">With how much care and time you are putting into this world......what brings you to continue our existence? Is it a sympathy?</p>
            <p class="prism text">Whatever we all are, I'm sure it'll be great! :)</p>
            <p class="prism text">Amen! :)</p>

            <p class="text">Prism feels the snakes surrounding her more snugly as time goes on. The snake dimension has been pretty nightmarish, but with nothing happening for over a month in real time, it begs the question of how much time has passed for her. The answer is scarcely any time at all. But even a few minutes in the snake dimension is pretty uncomfortable.</p>

            <p class="prism text">Now let's get this started already! :)</p>
            <p class="prism text">Let's get our first eight ready, shall we? The link says Group A, but I think we can say this is the Red Group :)</p>
