            <p class="prism text">Dear Spectrum :)</p>
            <p class="prism text">I pray to you at this time of strife and this time of chaos :)</p>
            <p class="prism text">I humble myself to you, and look to you in my times of doubt :)</p>
            <p class="prism text">As I'm sure that you see, the situation looks to be perilous, but I know that through you, I will be able to not only survive, but thrive in the greater good of what you are :)</p>
            <p class="prism text">But......</p>
            <p class="prism text">I've found myself asking a question to myself......one that I hope that you would be able to help me with.......</p>
            <p class="prism text">Why?</p>
            <p class="prism text">You created me to be a part of these tournaments, and I very much enjoy being a part of them, but......I can't help but to wonder why you created me for this......</p>
            <p class="prism text">To be a villain? I understand that. And I believe that I have served such a purpose well....but what is the purpose of this world you have created?</p>
            <p class="prism text">This world....it's chaotic....and it's fun. But I can see.......ideas......and messages.....stories of people overcoming their own trauma.......</p>
            <p class="prism text">With how much care and time you are putting into this world......what brings you to continue our existence? Is it a sympathy?</p>
            <p class="prism text">Whatever we all are, I'm sure it'll be great! :)</p>
            <p class="prism text">Amen! :)</p>

            <p class="text">Prism feels the snakes surrounding her more snugly as time goes on. The snake dimension has been pretty nightmarish, but with nothing happening for over a month in real time, it begs the question of how much time has passed for her. The answer is scarcely any time at all. But even a few minutes in the snake dimension is pretty uncomfortable.</p>

            <p class="prism text">Now let's get this started already! :)</p>
            <p class="prism text">Let's get our first eight ready, shall we? The link says Group A, but I think we can say this is the Red Group :)</p>

                Folk opens his eyes and looks around....he sees..........nothing.....well, not nothing....technically he sees everything. All colors unrestrained. But all of that sort of cancels out to become its own nonsense. Its own void of overstimulation.
            </p>

            <p class="text">
                "Oh, hey, you're here, too" He hears a voice echoing across the cacophony of color. "Makes sense. We're the two set to go forward in this thing." It's Crimson.
            </p>

            <p class="text">
                By instinct, he leaps up in a defensive stance. "Where.....the hell are we?"
            </p>

            <p class="text">
                Crimson is silent for a moment.  A moment that feels like an eternity for both of them. "Wish I could tell ya. Best I can tell is that it's a little jail cell that Prism's fixed up. Probably to hold us till the next tournament. Lazy bastard couldn't even decorate it......All you need to know is that you're...safe. We're gonna get outta this alright."
            </p>

            <p class="text">
                This is a lot of information to take in.....it would be a real shame if Crimson gave him more to deal with. "Honestly, it sucks that you all had to get roped into her horseshit" Well, crap. "I'm used to this, at least, but now she's subjecting all of you to this? Can't imagine it's great for you noobs"
            </p>

            <p class="text">
                Folk looks around, still absorbing the hyperstimulation. "You.....we have to make a plan"
            </p>

            <p class="text">
                Crimson only laughs, adding more stimulation in the form of sound, making it unintentionally all the more cruel. "Plan to do what? Change the trajectory? Do anything that can be easily changed at will? If you think that you can fight Prism, then frankly, you're a fucking moron. See, watch this!"
            </p>

            <p class="text">
                Crimson flashes a grin as he summons all of his godly power. His muscles strain as he absorbs not only his own available power, but any power that he may have in the future. Any restraint he's held in the past. A powerful blast is being prepared that could destroy even the strongest being any person could fathom <span class="prism">before it slowly calms itself down and Crimson returns to his former level of power. Attacking Prism is wrong :)</span>
            </p>

            <p class="text">
                "....y.....y'see?" Crimson's breaths are short and labored after summoning all that power only to be led to such an anticlimax. "Attacking her is bullshit."
            </p>

            <p class="text">
                Crimson's labored breathing is cut off with a shocked tremble when a hand is placed on his shoulder. The hand of Folk. "I didn't train to be a therapist for nothing, Crimson. And I think I have an idea."
            </p>

            <p class="text">
                "<span class="prism">What on earth is your idea, Folk? :) Are you going to have me talk about my childhood to death? :)</span>"

            <p class="text">
                Folk steps back for a moment, shocked by the sudden transformation before regaining his resolve. "I just have one question for you Prism....."

                "Why?"

            <p class="ryan text">Explanation for anyone who wants to know <span class="hide"><span class="ryan">basically during the start of HS, Aradia, one of the characters, is a ghost because she was killed by the <s>best character</s> her bf who was under mind control. Her vibe is somewhat similar. Megalovania is in Homestuck and while it's widely considered to be Vriskas theme by idiots, a common idea is that it is the theme of Aradia after she ascends and is no longer a ghost, becoming the second/third best character depending on how I'm feeling</span></span></p>

            <p class="text">It was a late night for some, but for the single father of this household, there was much to do tonight still. Or so he imagined. But for Nera, it was bedtime.</p>

            <p class="text">She was already tucked in, and her father was  just about to leave when he felt a light tugging on his sleeve. "Daddy.......can you....tell me a bedtime story?"</p>

            <p class="text">He felt a pressure weigh upon him. Not by his daughter, who had heard plentiful bedtime stories at this point, but by....something else. That sensation......ever since the first time he ran through <span class="note">the machine</span>................where......when was he? <span class="note">"Of course, pastrycakes!"</span></p>

            <p class="text">These days, he could recite these stories without the need for books. Could books write the stories he knew about? <span class="note">"So....this is the story of a silly guy......"</span></p>

            <p class="text"><span class="note">"So one day, there was this evil Doctor......and this Doctor, they were trying to do bad!"</span></p>

            <p class="text">The two erupted with laughter and glee as Nera's father watched over his daughter, happy to see her safe. "Ooh! Ooh! Daddy! Daddy! What was the evil Doctor's name?"</p>

            <p class="text">His laughter stopped immediately. <span class="note">"What do you mean?"</span></p>

            <p class="text">"Come on, daddy! They weren't just Doctor, right? They gotta have a name!!!!"</p>

            <p class="text">"So, wait a minute. Let me get this straight.....you're Crimson......and you're Crimson's Nobody?"</p>

            <p class="text">"For the love of God, if I gotta hear you talk about a Nobody one more time I'll turn ya to nobody, ya chipper asshole!"</p>

            <p class="text">"Time travel? So if you find 11 more of you, then-"</p>

            <p class="text">"CAN IT!"</p>

            <p class="text"><span class="prism">"I mean, technically both of you are heartless, aren't you? :)"</span></p>

            <p class="text">"GO BREAK YOUR LEGS AGAIN!"</p>

            <p class="text">Colors flew everywhere in this overstimulated void, and the tension between the eight bystanders rose to a peak. Despite the two newcomers being the least connected to the other six members, it was incredible just how much of a stir they had caused. Brunette Roxas did what Brunette Roxas was good at. Complicating everything.</p>

            <p class="text">Juniper, on the other hand, caused chaos in her own special way, sitting on top of Cobalt's head, smacking on Cobalt's skull playfully while Folk watched on, amused, but protective. Juniper's first arrival was a bit of a shock and Folk had made it his mission to keep Prism away from her at all cost, and with Cobalt seeming to be meditating or something to that effect, he was unable to keep watch over Juniper, but also unfazed by Juniper's drumming.</p>

            <p class="text">The spat between Crimson, Captain Crimson, Brunette Roxas, and Prismatic Dani was completely unproductive and meaningless in the context of their estranged dreamscape, but perhaps the overall tension of their situation was at a breaking point. After all, keeping Crimson in a room with Prism was contentious enough. Add Cobalt and things didn't get much better.</p>

            <p class="text">"Listen, Broxas, my buddy," the gravelly voice of Spriteman spoke up. "You gotta realize that all of this is a dream. Literally. Made by her," he pointed at Prismatic Dani, a bead of Sprite flying off his finger to match his dramatic point. "So the rules of reality are being controlled by her. Whether they're logical or not."</p>

            <p class="text">Brunette Roxas cocks his head, as if absorbing the information for the first time. "Why is she doing  <span class="prism">so great at fighting in this tournament? :)</span>"</p>

            <p class="text"><span class="prism">"Great question, Spriteman, haha!!! :) It's because I managed to control Dani! :) Hahahahahahahahaha :)"</span></p>

            <p class="text">The groan from Crimson pierced through Prism's nervous laughter. "Yeah, I know what you were tryin' to ask, she won't tell us either."</p>

            <p class="text">"And why should she? She's a god like us! She shouldn't have to answer to you!" came the boisterous voice of Captain Crimson.</p>

            <p class="text">After an unenthusiastic stare, Spriteman turns his gaze from the crimson captain to Roxas. "Just ignore him, he's from a different time."</p>

            <p class="text">"A different time, huh? Hell yeah it's a different time. Explains a lot since this Crimson's a big pansy, caring about mortals all of a sudden"</p>

            <p class="text">"What??? I don't care about them!"</p>

            <p class="text">"Bullshit! You told me that you hadn't left this universe since I showed up."</p>

            <p class="text">"Yeah, I was trying to disrupt the constants! It was part of my evil plan!"</p>

            <p class="text">"Some evil plan that was, and then you just stuck around after because mommy Prism came ar-"</p>

            <p class="cobalt text"><em><strong>"Prism!"</strong></em></p>

            <p class="text">Cobalt's eyes flew open so suddenly that Juniper almost fell off, leading Folk to run behind the blue god, preparing to catch her. "dear god.....is.....that what this has been all about?"</p>

            <p class="text">A hush falls over the eight of them, with all eyes looking at the possessed champion. <span class="prism">"Ummmmmmmmmmmmmmm could you be more specific? I don't know what you're talking about :)"</span></p>

            <p class="text">"Don't play dumb with me, Prism. I've been watching the tournament. I heard what Peppermint said under the darkness of Cosmic Love."</p>

            <p class="text"><span class="prism">"Hahahahaha!!!!! Probably something about a fanfiction, right? :)"</span></p>

            <p class="text">A sickening silence sits like a thick fog being moved erratically by the overloaded color.</p>

            <p class="text"><span class="prism">"...............right? :)"</span></p>

            <p class="text">For the first time in Cobalt's eternity of existence, there was something in Prism's voice. Something solemn. Something doubtful. Something afraid. Her half-hearted self-assurance lingered in the air as she walked away.</p>

            <p class="text">Folk looked up to the god of balance, concern plastered across his face. "Cobalt.....what's going on?"</p>

            <p class="text">His eyes rose to look at Juniper, who was looking down at him expectantly. "What is it, Bones Man?"</p>

            <p class="text">Cobalt sighed and approached his younger brother. "You saw it too?"</p>

            <p class="text">Crimson nodded solemnly. "Yeah.....yeah I saw it....do ya think that Chartreuse knew all along?"</p>

            <p class="text">"....perhaps that's why she did what she did...." after a moment of the two brothers reflecting on what they had heard on the battlefield, Cobalt picked up Juniper off of his head. "I....should tell the other mortals. They deserve to know. I feel like....she....isn't after the little one here, but Crimson....you keep her safe. If you don't...." he leaned in to whisper into Crimson's ear. "I'll make sure the definitive endpoint Peppermint mentioned is far earlier for you."</p>

            <p class="text">"Whoa, cool as hell one-liner there, but no need to worry, I'm a bastard, not a monster. Well...I am kind of a monster, but I'm not hurting a child."</p>

            <p class="text">"Especially because I can beat the crap outta you!!!!"</p>

            <p class="text">"Especially because she can beat the crap outta me"</p>

            <p class="text">Cobalt nodded again as he headed out to talk with the others.</p>

            <p class="text">"You're fleshy."</p>

            <p class="text">Juniper simply laughed in response. "So you do like a buncha different universes, right?"</p>

            <p class="text">Crimson's eyebrow perks up. "I mean, I'm the God of Dimensions, I have access to all kinds of other universes. Shocked you know about multiverse theory, though."</p>

            <p class="text">"Yeah!!! Google was talkin to me about it!!!! And he told me!!!! That!!!!! There!!! Um!!!! Theres a Universe!!!!!!! Where!!!!!! I drive a monster truck!!!! And it's the biggest monster truck in the world!!!!! And all the other monster trucks!!!!! Cry!!!!! In Fear!!!!!!!!!!!! And They All Write Letters To Their Monster Truck Families!!!!!! Saying!!!!! How they want their legacy to be remembered!!!!!! But MY Monster Truck EATS EM UP before they can finish!!!!!!"</p>

            <p class="text">After a moment of stunned silence and fighting back tears and/or rapturous applause, Crimson simply gave a laugh. "Well, I got great news for ya, kid! That IS a universe that exists!!!"</p>

            <p class="text">Her eyes grew wider than headlights. "<em>gaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaasp</em> I wanna see it!!! I wanna see it!!!!"</p>

            <p class="text">"Hey hey whoa! It's not as simple as that. There are an infinite number of multiverses. I can't just say hocus pocus give me the Juniper badass monster truck un-OW!!!!"</p>

            <p class="text">"Potty mouth...."</p>

            <p class="text">"Geez, sorry, kid! Bad...booty? monster truck universe? A lot of the time I gotta really....FEEL the universe. Like sometimes you can feel a universe calling to ya....like craving mac and cheese."</p>

            <p class="text">"I miss Mac and Cheese....."</p>

            <p class="text">"Oh man do I know that feeling. But yeah, usually it's by my gut, sometimes it's Spectrum, sometimes it's both."</p>

            <p class="text">"What's Spectrum?"</p>

            <p class="text">".......That's for another talk."</p>

            <p class="text">As if on cue, Cobalt had returned with Folk, Spriteman, and Brunette Roxas, all of them looking somewhat shaken by the news they had just head. Folk approached Crimson. "You weren't bein' a bad influence on her, were ya?"</p>

            <p class="text">Crimson chuckled to himself. "Nah, she's a good kid. I know her brother isn't around so....I guess it's neat you're kinda filling that role I guess."</p>

            <p class="text">Folk sat in silence, his eyes drifting away somewhat. "....yeah....."</p>

            <p class="text">"Hey.....Folk......."</p>

            <p class="text">He looked back up. "What?"</p>

        <div class="cutscene-start"></div>
        <div class="cutscene">
            <p class="text">It surrounded him like a mist.</p>

            <p class="text">It felt like a plague of eyes watching him.</p>

            <p class="text">It was indescribable. Impossible to even understand.</p>

            <p class="text">But from what he could understand....from what information he had been given.....he could come to a firm conclusion.</p>

            <p class="text">It was Spectrum.</p>

            <p class="text">Captain Quadratic had learned to ignore the strange feeling of a mist that clouded his mind sometimes. He still continued his daily life whenever the mist cleared from his head, but for some reason it felt....emptier? Not because he wasn't truly who he knew he was...it just felt....incomplete for whatever reason.</p>

            <p class="text">But he felt the mist again. He'd been waiting for days and there it was again. At this point in time, the mist was welcoming, but it entering his mind and leaving it at sudden points in time was just as natural as sleeping and waking up. But now that the mist was here....he knew that something was bound to happen. But where?</p>

            <p class="text">He decided to try his luck with his recent romantic partner, who was chatting with the witchy one with the scarf. "HELLO THERE, YOU TWO!! HELLO, TWIST!!! HELLO, MY RIGHT HAND ROBOT!! WHAT AN ADORABLE PET NAME! I JUST CAME UP WITH IT!" It was true! He did!</p>

            <p class="text">Rights Sentience initiated their giggle subroutine while motioning towards Twist. "Hello ((-b+sqrt(b^2-4ac))/2a)&amp;&amp;((-b-sqrt(b^2-4ac))/2a)! I was simply partaking in some speculative information collection (known also under alias 'gossip') with Twist here. It is rumored that Cha Cha is-"</p>

            <p class="text">Twist broke out laughing before they could finish, both due to the robot's loose lips and out of sheer shock of how they made that sound with their.....speakers? "RS! If you spill the beans that easy, it doesn't make it good gossip!!"</p>

            <p class="text">After a short pause, the robotic form nodded. "Confirmed."</p>

            <p class="text">Lowering herself down from laughter, Twist looked over to Captain Quadratic. "So what's goin' on with you, CQ? Any juicy gossip you'd like to share on anybody?"</p>

            <p class="text">Gossip.</p>

            <p class="text">After a search through some memory banks, he found a profile for this concept of gossip, both hearing it from place to place and utilizing the definition given by His Right Hand Robot.</p>

            <p class="text">Order had mentioned gossip before, mostly talking about the people in high school that she was jealous of. The memories loaded back</p>

            <p class="text">Memories of her talking about how Stephanie thought that <em>just</em> because she was the cheerleader that she was so much better than anyone else.</p>

            <p class="text">How Maggie probably has made out with half of the football team since she can't appreciate the pursuit of science</p>

            <p class="text">Memories of how that know-it-all in her class thought he was sooooo smart and always one-upped her and how she'd always wanted to take him out back and teach him a lesson, showing him he's not so tough and she'd pin him up against the wall after proving how much better she was and look into his deep and sad, pathetic, green eyes, slowly inching in closer and oh god quadratic delete that delete that did he did he hear that oh whew he's deactivated that would have been embarrassing</p>

            <p class="text">"NOT ABOUT ANYONE THAT WE WOULD KNOW ABOUT" <span class="prism">He said, not noticing the irony of his statement :)</span></p>

            <p class="text">FUCK! The mist!!!!</p>

            <p class="text">For just a brief moment that had already passed, the mist turned into an overbearing air full of technicolor neon needles. <em><strong><span class="white">SHE</span></strong></em> was doing something. And it was worse than usual.</p>

            <p class="text">"Quadratic? You are reacting quite strangely? Are you injured?" Apparently, that one had quite the reaction on him. He'd felt this pain before back with his fight with Google, but it felt more like a light ticklish sensation.....this one was significantly stronger for some reason, to the point of a sharp pain.</p>

            <p class="text">Twist jumped to a start and moved over to Quadratic quickly, a glowing hand approaching. "Oh my gosh, I knew that Doctor Order had weird plans, but seeing that....how much did she know about Spectrum already?"</p>

            <p class="text">"YOU......................YOU KNOW ABOUT SPECTRUM?"</p>

            <p class="text">Twist nodded. "I.....have a connection with Spectrum. I'm more surprised she knew about Prism."</p>

            <p class="text">So she saw it too......."THE........MIST............." <span class="prism">Actually, it's called The Script, but I wouldn't expect the brainiac to know that. :)</span></p>

            <p class="text">Another <span class="white">searing pain of technicolor needles</span> jabbed at his body.</p>

            <p class="text">"Dear god.....you felt this every time Prism interfered?"</p>

            <p class="text">"WASNT.....AS......STRONG...."</p>

            <p class="text">After a pause, Twist closed her eyes for a moment, her eyelids and hands glowing purple as the end of her scarf slowly rose up, as if being pulled on a string, her hair lightly fluttered by a wind that cannot be felt.</p>

            <p class="text">"Twist? May I request an update?"</p>

            <p class="text">She didn't respond, only allowing the wind underneath her to grow in intensity, pulling up the looser parts of her sweater. After a few intense moments, she spoke up, but not to her new acquaintance.</p>

            <p class="text">"Sorry about this, you guys. But you know that anti-Prism measure Quad has? I think it's intensified since we're in a dream....and that's...overwhelming him. That's my first guess, but it's the one we're going with for now. So we're gonna have to leave him out of these cutscenes just in case.....I'll try to get ahold of Nelson to update you guys....and Prism?"</p>

            <p class="text">Before The Script could be touched, her eyes flew open, revealing a shining purple light beaming out.</p>

            <p class="text">".....and then Twilight realized, hold on a minute I can just ASK Princess Celestia for four more tickets to the Gra- Whoa! Hey! Crimson! Is that a Snake?"</p>

            <p class="text">Crimson froze hearing the question asked, breaking him out of whatever conversation with a void goddess his mind was mired in. "What....did you just say?" He turned around to see a familiar sight. It was another array of colors shining brightly and somehow sticking out from the other overwhelming colors, which signalled the end of another branch of the tourney. But out of this one came.....a snake....had he awoken?</p>

            <p class="text"><span class="prism">"Oh god,oh god oh god oh god oh fuck oh god he's free :)"</span> the possessed Dantoinette said, panic hidden by a chipper demeanor as the eight approached the portal that had appeared, ready for whatever may come out.</p>

            <p class="text">The first thing to exit from the portal was Captain Quadratic, charging out, as if fearing for his life, tripping on the floor and rolling around by the feet of the others. "WHAT IN GODS NAME IS THAT THING????" he shouted as the sight of small serpents began to leak out of the portal.  The snakes had found its way into the story. And it had found the source. The epicenter.</p>

            <p class="text">And there weren't 10 people that any of them could forward the email to.</p>

            <p class="text">Juniper looked up at Crimson with a worried look in her eyes. "Crimbo? What....what is that?"</p>

            <p class="text">Crimson closed his eyes, gulping. "That's the Lord of the Snakes. No one knows where he came from. No one knows what he wants. No one knows why he exists. All that they know is that he is mindless.....he is virulent.....he is a force of destruction that none of us are even close to prepared for.....he's the end of everything."</p>

            <p class="text">Cobalt nodded softly as he looks over to his brother. "Crimson, get ahold of yourself. There are nine of us....and one of whatever this thing is. I understand that it is a fright, but I believe we can handle it. We MUST handle it."</p>

            <p class="text">As if responding to Cobalt's statement, the scene changed. At first it appears to be a cavalcade of countless snakes, most latching themselves to the side of the portal. To estimate the quantity of snakes in the thousands would be a conservative estimate. But other snakes erupted from the portal as makeshift small ropes. One of these ropes found itself wrapped around Cobalt's leg, tugging him to the ground, allowing more snake ropes to more easily restrain him. Shouts of shock echoed across the over stimulating space as Captain Crimson, Spriteman, Folk, Brunette Roxas, and Captain Quadratic were restrained as well.</p>

            <p class="text">But, the true horror came when they found out why there were so many snakes latching onto the edges of the portal.</p>

            <p class="text">They were dragging something through it.</p>

            <p class="text">A hulking, slithering mass, seeming to be made up entirely of millions of snakes, burst out of the portal, creating the form of what looked to be an enormous snake, seemingly stretching the bounds of the portal itself with its consistently slithering, bulking mass, with a pair of divots in the front creating the illusion of a pair of eyes. It let out a guttural roar that shook everyone, restrained or unrestrained.</p>

            <p class="text">"Crimson?" Juniper's voice shook as she tried to ask what this devilish beast even was.</p>

            <p class="prism text">"The Lord of Snakes :)"</p>

            <p class="text">"....what?"</p>

            <p class="prism text">"I knew it would be time sooner or later and that he would be done with us soon, but I thought that maybe he would at least finish this dream :)"</p>

            <p class="text">Crimson looked up at Prism in shock. Crimson knew about the Lord of Snakes, but what did Prism know? "Prism?? How the hell do you know about this guy?"</p>

            <p class="text">Dantoinette looks back at Crimson with....tears in her eyes.</p>

            <p class="prism text">"This is something I've tried to put off, but it was bound to happen :)"</p>

            <p class="text">Of course. "What??? Are you telling me???"</p>

            <p class="prism text">"Yes :) The story you've been told is another abstraction :) This will eat our universe as suddenly as it will swiftly :) And it's simply out of our control, no matter how hard I tried to keep it away :)"</p>

            <p class="text">Juniper swings her axe at a snake rope coming in. "What does she mean, Crimson?"</p>

            <p class="text">Crimson turns his hat to the side dramatically as he gives a long sigh. These are probably his final moments. He better make them count.</p>

            <p class="text">"Kid....CPU Kerfuffle might just be over." She wouldn't know what that meant. And that wasn't fair for Juniper. But most things are unfair. Especially with the god of balance incapacitated.</p>

            <p class="text">That's when he felt it. A snake clenching itself around his goopy leg before he could finish what he had wanted to say. Before he could react, Crimson feels himself flying into the air and careening faster than his mind could register towards the amalgam of snakes.</p>

            <p class="prism text">I watched him be consumed :)</p>

            <p class="prism text">It.......Oh my god....It's just me and Juniper....:)</p>

            <p class="prism text">Juniper is looking up at me right now, scared out of her mind :)</p>

            <p class="prism text">I know that I've made her feel that way.....I know the pain I've caused.... :)</p>

            <p class="prism text">I know how hurt she must be........it reminds me of Crimson.....:)</p>

            <p class="prism text">............I wish that I had one more chance to talk to Crimson :)</p>

            <p class="prism text">So I could tell him I'm sorry :)</p>

            <p class="prism text">Thinking about the pain I've caused him......caused her..... :)</p>

            <p class="prism text">It hurts me......every time.....:)</p>

            <p class="prism text">I just thought......maybe we could keep it going for just a little longer :)</p>

            <p class="prism text">We could have some more fun with Larry.........and Dani.....and Juniper.....Crimson.....:)</p>

            <p class="prism text">But when fear takes over...........I suppose I......went to a darker place :)</p>

            <p class="prism text">If you don't forgive me for this....I understand. :)</p>

            <p class="prism text">But, from the bottom of my heart, I want to say. :)</p>

            <p class="prism text">I'm sorry :)</p>

            <p class="prism text">I'm so....so sorry for everything :)</p>

            <p class="text">.................................</p>

            <p class="text">...................................................</p>

            <p class="text">.....................................................</p>

            <p class="text">................................................</p>

            <p class="text">Juniper Uppercut watches between axe swings as the rainbow-colored Dantoinette is absorbed by snakes.</p>

            <p class="text">She is alone again.</p>

            <p class="text">What does she do?</p>

            <p class="text">........</p>

            <p class="text">She plants her foot in the ground, holding her axe, fresh with the blood of tens of snakes already.</p>

            <p class="text">Maybe.......it can work on one big snake.</p>

            <p class="text">Juniper closes her eyes, imagining the voice of Alabaster echoing into her head a word of encouragement before her eyes flare open and she charges at the best, leaping axe first into the nightmare amalgam in this strange world, a cry of life blasting out from her.</p>

            <p class="text">If only such a spirit would be so effective.</p>

            <p class="text">As she makes contact, the snakes envelop her immediately, swarming over her. "No!" She shouts, hoping for someone to hear her, even though no one is there.</p>

            <p class="text">"NO!!!!" she repeats as the snakes envelop her form. The last thing she sees before going under completely is the same thing happening to all of her friends from Dantoinette to Crimson to Cobalt. Everyone is being absorbed.</p>

            <p class="text"><em>NO!!!</em> she can't say anything, too covered by snakes. All that she has is her despair. It was over.</p>

            <p class="text"><em>......no..........</em> This beast was too powerful. A beast of pure dysfunction. A beast the feeds upon what is incomplete. A beast that feeds upon potential unrealized. Spectrum's creations which do not fully manifest. And it seems that she is next......when she feels a hand grab a hold of hers.......</p>

            <p class="text"><em>.............n............yes?..........</em></p>

            <p class="text">The hand yanks Juniper all of a sudden as a newfound sense of vigor flows through her body through this new hand . The thoughts only came back stronger.</p>

            <p class="text"><em>Yes......</em></p>

            <p class="text">A shining light seemed to shine from Juniper as she was dragged through the countless mass of snakes, a feeling of power coursing through her veins like she just ate a hundred pixie stix.</p>

            <p class="text"><em>Yes!</em></p>

            <p class="text">Suddenly, Juniper is jerked airborne as the hand that holds her jumps high into the sky, taking the young girl with her.</p>

            <p class="text"><em>YES!!!!!!</em></p>

            <p class="text">From up above everything, the entire world is still very overwhelming, but the dark and miserable snake colossus stands out like a sore thumb. She can see that she's right on top of it, all it was going to take was a little boost, which the hand that held her was willing to provide, saying exactly what Juniper was thinking.</p>

            <p class="text">The sound started as a low hum</p>

            <p class="text">And only grew louder</p>

            <p class="justice text">"mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmMMMMMMMMMYYYYYYYYYYYEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEESSSSSSSSSSSSSSS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"</p>

            <p class="text">With that shout, Juniper goes careening at an unfathomable speed toward the giant snake. She keeps her composure against the blistering wind on her face to lead with the axe.</p>

            <p class="justice text">"YYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEHHHHHHHHHHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW!!!"</p>

            <p class="text">The collision feels like it's in slow motion.</p>

            <p class="text">The axe shines with the light of balance.</p>

            <p class="text">The light of tragedy.</p>

            <p class="text">The light of treachery.</p>

            <p class="text">The light of imagination.</p>

            <p class="text">The light of love.</p>

            <p class="text">The light of power.</p>

            <p class="text">The light of triumph.</p>

            <p class="text">The light of laughter.</p>

            <p class="text">The light of pride.</p>

            <p class="text">The light of beauty.</p>

            <p class="text">The light of sorrow.</p>

            <p class="text">The light of ideas.</p>

            <p class="text">The light of rage.</p>

            <p class="text">The light of inspiration.</p>

            <p class="text">The light of justice.</p>

            <p class="text">The light of <span class="white">Spectrum</span>.</p>

            <p class="text">As if a magic spell had been cast, there is a blinding flash of light, and an animalistic roar of pain......and with that.....the beast is no more......</p>

            <p class="prism text">Hah! Haha!!!!! I'm alive!!!!!! :) What the hell just happened?! :)</p>

            <p class="prism text">There were snakes, it was all about to end, but now it's.....not there anymore....? :)</p>

            <p class="prism text">I blacked out for a bit, but- Is that....Painguin? :) ....on the other side of the portal? :)</p>

        </div>

        <div class="cutscene-start"></div>
        <div class="cutscene">
            <p class="text"><span class="prism">Dantoinette stared into the assorted array of colors as the group behind her watching the tourney hosted their discussions surrounding the contestants. :) Dani didn't really have much to say....she had a lot on her mind at the moment, between the encounter with the snakes a while ago and the newly formed lump on her head from a certain heavy auto part. :)</span></p>
            <p class="text"><span class="prism">Suddenly a rogue thought appeared in her head :)</span></p>
            <p class="text"><em>"Didn't take you for the type that knew how to apologize, Prism."</em></p>
            <p class="text"><span class="prism">"Oh, you heard that? :)"</span></p>
            <p class="text"><em>"Don't really have much of a choice. Y'know, with the whole taking over my body thing."</em></p>
            <p class="text"><span class="prism">Well....above all else, I hope you realize I was genuine in what I said. :) I am truly, truly sorry about the pain that I have caused. :)</span></p>
            <p class="text"><em>"Oh believe me, Prism, my heart is moved. You can't see it since, you know, don't have a body, but I'm crying my eyes out over here. It's like you put on Marley and Me. But you wanna know what would do a REALLY good job of showing how sorry you are?"</em></p>
            <p class="text"><span class="prism">.....is it g-:)</span></p>
            <p class="text"><em>"GIVING ME MY BODY BACK, PRISM!"</em></p>
            <p class="text">"Prism?"</p>
            <p class="text"><span class="prism">A voice came from behind Prismatic Dani, speaking almost simultaneously with the voice in her head, almost leading her to not even notice it. :) When she turned around, she saw that it was the rugged dog himself, Folk. :) Now what on earth was he about to chew her out for? :)</span></p>
            <p class="text"><span class="prism">"I see that look in your eye, Folk! :) I'm assuming since Therapuppy got some memories back, maybe you did, too? :) You're not too traumatized, are-"</span></p>
            <p class="text">"That ain't what I'm here for, Prism," <span class="prism">his voice seemed calm and...almost gentle. :)</span> "I DID get some memories back, but I'm here to pick up where my past self left off. After all, our session had you give me those memories and that was it. I wanna ask YOU some questions"</p>
            <p class="text"><span class="prism">"I think my situation is pretty simple, Folk. :) I'm the right hand of Spectrum, the God of Creation. :) I was tasked to help create this story that you're living in right now. And I'm going to make certain that your story is the best that it can be :)"</span></p>
            <p class="text">"....and you mentioned this story is ending?"</p>
            <p class="text"><span class="prism">"Yes :) Yes it is :)"</span></p>
            <p class="text"><span class="prism">Folk pondered for a moment, rubbing his chin, before taking a seat on what could be described as a floor in loose terms :). It was invisible to truly give the idea of a multicolored void, but he took a seat anyway, appearing as if he was floating :)</span> "So....you're older than all of us, yeah? Even older than Crimson and Treusey?"</p>
            <p class="text"><span class="prism">"Yep! I've existed for all time! :) Even before time, predating your lovely lady :)"</span></p>
            <p class="text">"And you remember all of it?"</p>
            <p class="text">"Even the parts that....aren't part of our story?"</p>
            <p class="text"><span class="prism">"Yes, I do :) I am tied to the story that this world was made to create, but I have still lived my entire existence here :)"</span></p>
            <p class="text">"I'm sorry if I'm prying, but...sounds rough, huh? Living an eternity in a world you know is doomed to die?"</p>
            <p class="text">Prismatic Dani shifted somewhat uncomfortably, keeping the smile on her face no matter what. <span class="prism">"It's not too rough. :) You just take it day by day. :) When I was helping to form everything, I didn't think about the fact it would all end. :) The only thing that was important is that it would make a good story. :)"</span></p>
            <p class="text"><em>"So what was my ending, Prism?"</em></p>
            <p class="text"><span class="prism">Spoilers, Dani :)</span></p>
            <p class="text"><em>"If you Sopranos me, I swear to god..."</em></p>
            <p class="text">"A good story, huh?" Folk paused for a moment, tapping his fingers on the invisible floor, creating a silent tapping motion. "So while you were building all of this, did you have an idea for a sort of...ideal state of being? Like, you'd wake up one morning and think 'You know what? I'm happy!'. Did you ever have that?"</p>
            <p class="text"><span class="prism">Prism nodded enthusiastically :) "It was all very vague since there are plenty of elements that you all like to do outside my control, but it was fantastic! The great evils defeated, perhaps a grand heroic sacrifice, maybe a fun little scene of Squid Jenny asking Vampire Catgirl Tifa out. Everything you'd expect from a happy ending save for a dance party :)"</span></p>
            <p class="text">"....That sounds really great, Prism"</p>
            <p class="text"><span class="prism">"Thank you :)"</span></p>
            <p class="text">"But that's not what I asked"</p>
            <p class="text"><span class="prism">"......:)"</span></p>
            <p class="text">"What was your ideal version of the future? Where did you see yourself happy and satisfied with what you had done here?"</p>
            <p class="text">Seconds turned into minutes.</p>
            <p class="text"><span class="prism">"I'm sorry this is taking so long :)"</span></p>
            <p class="text">"No worries."</p>
            <p class="text">A few more minutes passed, the smile on Prismatic Dani's face unwavering, but something behind it slowly sinking.</p>
            <p class="text"><span class="prism">"What about you, Folk? :)"</span></p>
            <p class="text">"Me? Well, I know before everything went down, I always imagined I would settle down, maybe meet someone, and spend my days helping people through all their own problems. Maybe at the end of the day I'd go out on a porch with some peach tea. Watch the sunset. After everything's gone down, including the whole Doctor Order apocalypse fiasco, I guess it's about the same."</p>
            <p class="text">"Only difference is...I guess I have someone to share that peach tea with now."</p>
            <p class="text"><span class="prism">"And you would be happy living such a life? :)"</span></p>
            <p class="text">"I mean, there'd be the occasional roof leak or something, but for the most part...yeah. I think that I'd be happily living my life."</p>
            <p class="text"><span class="prism">"........I......cannot imagine that sort of life :)"</span></p>
            <p class="text"><span class="prism">"I am made to create :)"</span></p>
            <p class="text"><span class="prism">"Any future that I see for myself is the future of my own creation :)"</span></p>
            <p class="text"><span class="prism">"I don't see.....myself....in my future :)"</span></p>
            <p class="text"><span class="prism">".............................I envy you, Folk :)"</span> Tears streamed past her wide smile.</p>
            <p class="text">Folk slowly stood up, detecting he'd gotten somewhere, but to press harder might be a bit too much emotional pressure. "Do...you want me to stick around?"</p>
            <p class="text"><span class="prism">"No thank you :)"</span></p>
            <p class="text">".....alright, just...just remember that despite everything you've done...despite the pain you've caused....despite all the wrongdoings.....and despite the consequences you deserve to face for them....you're still worthy of love, Prism. You deserve to love yourself."</p>
            <p class="text"><span class="prism">"I don't know how you can say that. :) I almost erased you from existence :). And all so that I could torment the one you love. :)"</span></p>
            <p class="text">Folk began to walk away, turning his head to give a final message before returning to the rest of the group.</p>
            <p class="text">"The word 'never' ain't conditional."</p>

        <div class="cutscene-start"></div>
        <div class="cutscene">
            <p class="text">"Alright, next!" The shockingly mundane voice of the hydra's head boomed through the hall as a spirit of someone wicked nervously approached his desk.</p>
            <p class="text"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOhMmVeNd0M">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOhMmVeNd0M</a> <span class="note">[Pause Menu [Extended] - Mario Strikers Charged OST]</span></p>
            <p class="text">"Um.....wh....where-"</p>
            <p class="text">"Name?" The light blue lizard's head asked nonchalantly without looking up from his sudoku puzzle.</p>
            <p class="text">He was on admissions today, which wasn't quite as bad as the usual paperwork that ╬╬╬╬╬╬╬╬ was tasked with today, but...ironically....Sauerkraut ended up being the lucky one today with overseeing eternal torment. Which, honestly, might have been good. He seemed to be in the dumps...well....more than he usually was...so venting out those emotions to the eternally damned might help in a way.</p>
            <p class="text">The cursed soul shifted his feet slightly. "U-um.....Richard...........Sibley? Where....am I? Why am I in these chains?"</p>
            <p class="text">Jonny didn't even look up from his Sudoku puzzle. How could he? He was so close to figuring out where the hell (no pun intended) to put this 5.</p>
            <p class="text">"Yeah, you're in hell. I dunno if you didn't put it together from the fire and brimstone or if you're still in denial about it, but yeah. The big S deemed you not worthy. Not my decision, I just watch over this place. No, there was not some kind of mistake. No, we do not accept games of chess, and even if we did, we have more experience than your brain could fathom, and your defeat is inevitable. Also, we do not accept deals, that's the balance guy's game. And finally, no there are no cute demon girls. Any more questions?"</p>
            <p class="text">Richard shook in his ethereal boots at the onslaught of new information he had received. "How....how did I die?"</p>
            <p class="text">"OH SHIT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"</p>
            <p class="text">The sudden outburst from the frigid dragon caused the judged spectre to jump. "Wh-what is it?" A look of hope spread across his face. Perhaps there WAS a mistake! Perhaps he wasn't damned to- "THATS where the 5 goes!" the dragon picks up his pencil with his mouth and expertly writes the number "5" in one of the Sudoku squares. Despite using his mouth, he had perfect handwriting.</p>
            <p class="text">"Oh yeah, and to answer your question, you were killed in your sleep after you wrote a blatantly racist law that severely restricted the rights of the Inuit population and spread propaganda to dehumanize them. The person who killed you was based." Jonny hit a button at his desk, immediately opening a trapdoor  to drop Richard into the depths.</p>
            <p class="text">"Next!!!!"</p>
            <p class="text">Suddenly, he felt a tugging from his other neck. It was ╬╬╬╬╬╬╬╬. These kinds of emergency Korioni head meetings were rare, even after the eternity they spent ruling together, so he responded immediately, retreating his head back through the passage behind the desk.</p>
            <p class="text">After retracting his head, he found himself in their room, dimly lit with torchlight to give it that rustic look, with the three holes standing in front of them. One leading to admissions, on leading to the office, and one leading to the damnation chamber. ╬╬╬╬╬╬╬╬ had already retracted his head from the treasury slot as his tugging had called this meeting, and Sauerkraut was still in the damnation chamber.</p>
            <p class="text">"Hey, hey, what's goin' on, ╬╬╬╬╬╬╬╬?"</p>
            <p class="text">╬╬╬╬╬╬╬╬ responded with his usual bluster. "Greetings, Jonny! I felt this meeting was absolutely integral to truly continue our reign over hell and continue to torment the wretched souls that plague the mortal coil and deliver the punishment they deserve!"</p>
            <p class="text">"Nifty, so, like, what's up tho?"</p>
            <p class="text">╬╬╬╬╬╬╬╬'s head reaches into the corner of the room to grab a scroll. "Well, I am certain you recall a few months ago when Spectrum's emissary arrived at the gates of hell for inspection, yes?"</p>
            <p class="text">Of course,  how could he forget? She was a pretty pleasant person, had an iconic smile, and she absolutely had the ability to overwrite literally anything that any of them said or thought, but save for that little hiccup, she seemed pretty chill. "Yeah, what about it?"</p>
            <p class="text">"Well, after ruminating within my chamber for days upon days, thinking back upon everything that she had said, I believe that-"</p>
            <p class="text">"-thaaaaat she was gonna shut us down. Yeah, I know you were kinda worried about that."</p>
            <p class="text">A cold mist emanated from ╬╬╬╬╬╬╬╬'s nostrils. "'Kind of worried?' Jonny, I understand that you are rather lackadaisical by nature, however I would imagine that you would take her statements far more seriously, especially as someone coming directly from Spectrum!"</p>
            <p class="text">"...oooohhhhhhhhhh, you don't know? Sorry, I thought it was common knowledge. This one's on me, ╬╬╬╬╬╬╬╬!"</p>
            <p class="text">"On you, what in th-"</p>
            <p class="text">"She can't do anything to us. Even if she wanted to. It's outside the jurisdiction of her purpose. She's bound to the narrative, which is something that we sure as hell aren't bound to."</p>
            <p class="text">╬╬╬╬╬╬╬╬ paused. "Her purpose is the narrative, then?"</p>
            <p class="text">Jonny nodded. "Yep, so we're fine. We dipped our heads in a little bit and gave clearance for a single narrative intrusion into our lives under the stipulation that our status quo be unaffected. In fact, I'd wager that right now is that moment. Smile for the camera."</p>
            <p class="text">"So then, why did the brightly colored menace threaten to take us down?"</p>
            <p class="text">"Pretty sure it was to get a rise out of Sauerkraut."</p>
            <p class="text">"Of course...however the source of her potential affinity for cruelty might be tied to the information I had found."</p>
            <p class="text">Jonny's attention was caught by this. "Ohoho, really? And what info did you find?"</p>
            <p class="text">"The narrative will end soon."</p>
            <p class="text">Jonny's attention was lost just as quickly, his mind going back to the numbers that floated around his Sudoku. "Oh, wow, it comes to an end, does it? Next you'll tell me that 2 plus 2 is 4 or that time is cyclical. I really don't see why this couldn't wait until the end of the shift, but to be fair, it's on me for not keeping you informed about Prism's purpose."</p>
            <p class="text">Jonny began to slither his way back to admissions, when he heard his other head speak once again "I wonder what it must feel like to hold immortal purpose over something that is definitively finite. Our purpose is to watch over hell. We have found comfort in our purpose. We live to fulfill the purpose. We do so successfully. And because of this we are content." Another pause. "What is the fate of this vestigial appendage of Spectrum? To exist without purpose..... To be forced to exist knowing that your purpose has been fulfilled? What drives one to awaken?"</p>
            <p class="text">Jonny stopped before entering. "That's....not really our problem. But she seems pretty good at tormenting people. It might not fit her predetermined purpose so who knows if she would feel any fulfillment from it, but we can check for openings if you really care about her."</p>
            <p class="text">"CARE? AS IF I COULD CARE FOR A BEING SUCH AS THIS" ╬╬╬╬╬╬╬╬ snapped back almost immediately. As if on cue, the third head of the hydra emerged from its hole.</p>
            <p class="text">"Hey guys, sorry I was late, I was getting bullied by one of the souls and I had to structure a tortue chamber bad enough for him to feel true pain, I didn't miss anything, did I?"</p>
            <p class="text">╬╬╬╬╬╬╬╬, still heated by Jonny's accusation shouted back, holding back slightly as to ensure it wasn't taken personally. "YES YOU DID SAUERKRAUT, YOU MISSED THE ENTIRE CONVERSATION"</p>
            <p class="text">"Awwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww"</p>
