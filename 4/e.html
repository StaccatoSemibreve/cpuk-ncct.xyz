            <p class="text">"So, wait a minute. Let me get this straight.....you're Crimson......and you're Crimson's Nobody?"</p>

            <p class="text">"For the love of God, if I gotta hear you talk about a Nobody one more time I'll turn ya to nobody, ya chipper asshole!"</p>

            <p class="text">"I already am, though!"</p>

            <p class="text">"GOD! Cap, back me up here."</p>

            <p class="text">"Go eat a fat one, Jr."</p>

            <p class="text">"JUNIOR??? I'm OLDER than you!!!"</p>

            <p class="text">"Yeah, but I'm from earlier on in the timeline, which means I have seniority!"</p>

            <p class="text">"That is absolutely NOT what it means!"</p>

            <p class="text">"Time travel? So if you find 11 more of you, then-"</p>

            <p class="text">"CAN IT!"</p>

            <p class="text"><span class="prism">"I mean, technically both of you are heartless, aren't you? :)"</span></p>

            <p class="text">"GO BREAK YOUR LEGS AGAIN!"</p>

            <p class="text">Colors flew everywhere in this overstimulated void, and the tension between the eight bystanders rose to a peak. Despite the two newcomers being the least connected to the other six members, it was incredible just how much of a stir they had caused. Brunette Roxas did what Brunette Roxas was good at. Complicating everything.</p>

            <p class="text">Juniper, on the other hand, caused chaos in her own special way, sitting on top of Cobalt's head, smacking on Cobalt's skull playfully while Folk watched on, amused, but protective. Juniper's first arrival was a bit of a shock and Folk had made it his mission to keep Prism away from her at all cost, and with Cobalt seeming to be meditating or something to that effect, he was unable to keep watch over Juniper, but also unfazed by Juniper's drumming.</p>

            <p class="text">The spat between Crimson, Captain Crimson, Brunette Roxas, and Prismatic Dani was completely unproductive and meaningless in the context of their estranged dreamscape, but perhaps the overall tension of their situation was at a breaking point. After all, keeping Crimson in a room with Prism was contentious enough. Add Cobalt and things didn't get much better.</p>

            <p class="text">"Listen, Broxas, my buddy," the gravelly voice of Spriteman spoke up. "You gotta realize that all of this is a dream. Literally. Made by her," he pointed at Prismatic Dani, a bead of Sprite flying off his finger to match his dramatic point. "So the rules of reality are being controlled by her. Whether they're logical or not."</p>

            <p class="text">Brunette Roxas cocks his head, as if absorbing the information for the first time. "Why is she doing  <span class="prism">so great at fighting in this tournament? :)</span>"</p>

            <p class="text"><span class="prism">"Great question, Spriteman, haha!!! :) It's because I managed to control Dani! :) Hahahahahahahahaha :)"</span></p>

            <p class="text">The groan from Crimson pierced through Prism's nervous laughter. "Yeah, I know what you were tryin' to ask, she won't tell us either."</p>

            <p class="text">"And why should she? She's a god like us! She shouldn't have to answer to you!" came the boisterous voice of Captain Crimson.</p>

            <p class="text">After an unenthusiastic stare, Spriteman turns his gaze from the crimson captain to Roxas. "Just ignore him, he's from a different time."</p>

            <p class="text">"A different time, huh? Hell yeah it's a different time. Explains a lot since this Crimson's a big pansy, caring about mortals all of a sudden"</p>

            <p class="text">"What??? I don't care about them!"</p>

            <p class="text">"Bullshit! You told me that you hadn't left this universe since I showed up."</p>

            <p class="text">"Yeah, I was trying to disrupt the constants! It was part of my evil plan!"</p>

            <p class="text">"Some evil plan that was, and then you just stuck around after because mommy Prism came ar-"</p>

            <p class="cobalt text"><em><strong>"Prism!"</strong></em></p>

            <p class="text">Cobalt's eyes flew open so suddenly that Juniper almost fell off, leading Folk to run behind the blue god, preparing to catch her. "dear god.....is.....that what this has been all about?"</p>

            <p class="text">A hush falls over the eight of them, with all eyes looking at the possessed champion. <span class="prism">"Ummmmmmmmmmmmmmm could you be more specific? I don't know what you're talking about :)"</span></p>

            <p class="text">"Don't play dumb with me, Prism. I've been watching the tournament. I heard what Peppermint said under the darkness of Cosmic Love."</p>

            <p class="text"><span class="prism">"Hahahahaha!!!!! Probably something about a fanfiction, right? :)"</span></p>

            <p class="text">A sickening silence sits like a thick fog being moved erratically by the overloaded color.</p>

            <p class="text"><span class="prism">"...............right? :)"</span></p>

            <p class="text">For the first time in Cobalt's eternity of existence, there was something in Prism's voice. Something solemn. Something doubtful. Something afraid. Her half-hearted self-assurance lingered in the air as she walked away.</p>

            <p class="text">Folk looked up to the god of balance, concern plastered across his face. "Cobalt.....what's going on?"</p>

            <p class="text">His eyes rose to look at Juniper, who was looking down at him expectantly. "What is it, Bones Man?"</p>

            <p class="text">Cobalt sighed and approached his younger brother. "You saw it too?"</p>

            <p class="text">Crimson nodded solemnly. "Yeah.....yeah I saw it....do ya think that Chartreuse knew all along?"</p>

            <p class="text">"....perhaps that's why she did what she did...." after a moment of the two brothers reflecting on what they had heard on the battlefield, Cobalt picked up Juniper off of his head. "I....should tell the other mortals. They deserve to know. I feel like....she....isn't after the little one here, but Crimson....you keep her safe. If you don't...." he leaned in to whisper into Crimson's ear. "I'll make sure the definitive endpoint Peppermint mentioned is far earlier for you."</p>

            <p class="text">"Whoa, cool as hell one-liner there, but no need to worry, I'm a bastard, not a monster. Well...I am kind of a monster, but I'm not hurting a child."</p>

            <p class="text">"Especially because I can beat the crap outta you!!!!"</p>

            <p class="text">"Especially because she can beat the crap outta me"</p>

            <p class="text">Cobalt nodded again as he headed out to talk with the others.</p>

            <p class="text">"You're goopy!!!!" the young girl exclaimed, sticking her hand into Crimson's raw form.</p>

            <p class="text">"You're fleshy."</p>

            <p class="text">Juniper simply laughed in response. "So you do like a buncha different universes, right?"</p>

            <p class="text">Crimson's eyebrow perks up. "I mean, I'm the God of Dimensions, I have access to all kinds of other universes. Shocked you know about multiverse theory, though."</p>

            <p class="text">"Yeah!!! Google was talkin to me about it!!!! And he told me!!!! That!!!!! There!!! Um!!!! Theres a Universe!!!!!!! Where!!!!!! I drive a monster truck!!!! And it's the biggest monster truck in the world!!!!! And all the other monster trucks!!!!! Cry!!!!! In Fear!!!!!!!!!!!! And They All Write Letters To Their Monster Truck Families!!!!!! Saying!!!!! How they want their legacy to be remembered!!!!!! But MY Monster Truck EATS EM UP before they can finish!!!!!!"</p>

            <p class="text">After a moment of stunned silence and fighting back tears and/or rapturous applause, Crimson simply gave a laugh. "Well, I got great news for ya, kid! That IS a universe that exists!!!"</p>

            <p class="text">Her eyes grew wider than headlights. "<em>gaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaasp</em> I wanna see it!!! I wanna see it!!!!"</p>

            <p class="text">"Hey hey whoa! It's not as simple as that. There are an infinite number of multiverses. I can't just say hocus pocus give me the Juniper badass monster truck un-OW!!!!"</p>

            <p class="text">"Potty mouth...."</p>

            <p class="text">"Geez, sorry, kid! Bad...booty? monster truck universe? A lot of the time I gotta really....FEEL the universe. Like sometimes you can feel a universe calling to ya....like craving mac and cheese."</p>

            <p class="text">"I miss Mac and Cheese....."</p>

            <p class="text">"Oh man do I know that feeling. But yeah, usually it's by my gut, sometimes it's Spectrum, sometimes it's both."</p>

            <p class="text">"What's Spectrum?"</p>

            <p class="text">".......That's for another talk."</p>

            <p class="text">As if on cue, Cobalt had returned with Folk, Spriteman, and Brunette Roxas, all of them looking somewhat shaken by the news they had just head. Folk approached Crimson. "You weren't bein' a bad influence on her, were ya?"</p>

            <p class="text">Crimson chuckled to himself. "Nah, she's a good kid. I know her brother isn't around so....I guess it's neat you're kinda filling that role I guess."</p>

            <p class="text">Folk sat in silence, his eyes drifting away somewhat. "....yeah....."</p>

            <p class="text">"Hey.....Folk......."</p>

            <p class="text">He looked back up. "What?"</p>

            <p class="text">"Make it count"</p>

        <div class="cutscene-start"></div>
        <div class="cutscene">
            <p class="text">It surrounded him like a mist.</p>

            <p class="text">It felt like a plague of eyes watching him.</p>

            <p class="text">It was indescribable. Impossible to even understand.</p>

            <p class="text">But from what he could understand....from what information he had been given.....he could come to a firm conclusion.</p>

            <p class="text">It was Spectrum.</p>

            <p class="text">Captain Quadratic had learned to ignore the strange feeling of a mist that clouded his mind sometimes. He still continued his daily life whenever the mist cleared from his head, but for some reason it felt....emptier? Not because he wasn't truly who he knew he was...it just felt....incomplete for whatever reason.</p>

            <p class="text">But he felt the mist again. He'd been waiting for days and there it was again. At this point in time, the mist was welcoming, but it entering his mind and leaving it at sudden points in time was just as natural as sleeping and waking up. But now that the mist was here....he knew that something was bound to happen. But where?</p>

            <p class="text">He decided to try his luck with his recent romantic partner, who was chatting with the witchy one with the scarf. "HELLO THERE, YOU TWO!! HELLO, TWIST!!! HELLO, MY RIGHT HAND ROBOT!! WHAT AN ADORABLE PET NAME! I JUST CAME UP WITH IT!" It was true! He did!</p>

            <p class="text">Rights Sentience initiated their giggle subroutine while motioning towards Twist. "Hello ((-b+sqrt(b^2-4ac))/2a)&amp;&amp;((-b-sqrt(b^2-4ac))/2a)! I was simply partaking in some speculative information collection (known also under alias 'gossip') with Twist here. It is rumored that Cha Cha is-"</p>

            <p class="text">Twist broke out laughing before they could finish, both due to the robot's loose lips and out of sheer shock of how they made that sound with their.....speakers? "RS! If you spill the beans that easy, it doesn't make it good gossip!!"</p>

            <p class="text">After a short pause, the robotic form nodded. "Confirmed."</p>

            <p class="text">Lowering herself down from laughter, Twist looked over to Captain Quadratic. "So what's goin' on with you, CQ? Any juicy gossip you'd like to share on anybody?"</p>

            <p class="text">Gossip.</p>

            <p class="text">After a search through some memory banks, he found a profile for this concept of gossip, both hearing it from place to place and utilizing the definition given by His Right Hand Robot.</p>

            <p class="text">Order had mentioned gossip before, mostly talking about the people in high school that she was jealous of. The memories loaded back</p>

            <p class="text">Memories of her talking about how Stephanie thought that <em>just</em> because she was the cheerleader that she was so much better than anyone else.</p>

            <p class="text">How Maggie probably has made out with half of the football team since she can't appreciate the pursuit of science</p>

            <p class="text">Memories of how that know-it-all in her class thought he was sooooo smart and always one-upped her and how she'd always wanted to take him out back and teach him a lesson, showing him he's not so tough and she'd pin him up against the wall after proving how much better she was and look into his deep and sad, pathetic, green eyes, slowly inching in closer and oh god quadratic delete that delete that did he did he hear that oh whew he's deactivated that would have been embarrassing</p>

            <p class="text">"NOT ABOUT ANYONE THAT WE WOULD KNOW ABOUT" <span class="prism">He said, not noticing the irony of his statement :)</span></p>

            <p class="text">FUCK! The mist!!!!</p>

            <p class="text">For just a brief moment that had already passed, the mist turned into an overbearing air full of technicolor neon needles. <em><strong><span class="white">SHE</span></strong></em> was doing something. And it was worse than usual.</p>

            <p class="text">"Quadratic? You are reacting quite strangely? Are you injured?" Apparently, that one had quite the reaction on him. He'd felt this pain before back with his fight with Google, but it felt more like a light ticklish sensation.....this one was significantly stronger for some reason, to the point of a sharp pain.</p>

            <p class="text">Twist jumped to a start and moved over to Quadratic quickly, a glowing hand approaching. "Oh my gosh, I knew that Doctor Order had weird plans, but seeing that....how much did she know about Spectrum already?"</p>

            <p class="text">"YOU......................YOU KNOW ABOUT SPECTRUM?"</p>

            <p class="text">Twist nodded. "I.....have a connection with Spectrum. I'm more surprised she knew about Prism."</p>

            <p class="text">So she saw it too......."THE........MIST............." <span class="prism">Actually, it's called The Script, but I wouldn't expect the brainiac to know that. :)</span></p>

            <p class="text">Another <span class="white">searing pain of technicolor needles</span> jabbed at his body.</p>

            <p class="text">"Dear god.....you felt this every time Prism interfered?"</p>

            <p class="text">"WASNT.....AS......STRONG...."</p>

            <p class="text">After a pause, Twist closed her eyes for a moment, her eyelids and hands glowing purple as the end of her scarf slowly rose up, as if being pulled on a string, her hair lightly fluttered by a wind that cannot be felt.</p>

            <p class="text">"Twist? May I request an update?"</p>

            <p class="text">She didn't respond, only allowing the wind underneath her to grow in intensity, pulling up the looser parts of her sweater. After a few intense moments, she spoke up, but not to her new acquaintance.</p>

            <p class="text">"Sorry about this, you guys. But you know that anti-Prism measure Quad has? I think it's intensified since we're in a dream....and that's...overwhelming him. That's my first guess, but it's the one we're going with for now. So we're gonna have to leave him out of these cutscenes just in case.....I'll try to get ahold of Nelson to update you guys....and Prism?"</p>

            <p class="text">Before The Script could be touched, her eyes flew open, revealing a shining purple light beaming out.</p>
