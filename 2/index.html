                Dani looks down at the slip of paper. She&#39;s starting to feel the bags under her eyes as the url burned into her skull. &quot;<a href="https://challonge.com/DreamKerfuffle2">http://challonge.com/DreamKerfuffle2</a> &quot;..... what in the hell does it mean. She pulled out her phone and entered the url again. The page ended up loading <span class="prism">absolutely nothing :)</span>! What the hell did it mean? And what was Prism doing in her dreams? Would it even be a good idea to sleep?

            <p class="text">
                &quot;DANTOINETTE!&quot; came a sudden shout so loud, it felt like a light turned on in her brain. <span class="prism">I just think all this clicking is tedious :)</span> <span class="note">[note: all dialogue up to this point was contained in spoiler tags]</span> Well, at least sleep isn&#39;t going to take her slowly with Captain Quadratic entering the room. &quot;DID YOU FEEL THAT JUST NOW?&quot;
            </p>
            <p class="text">Dani shakes her head, covering one of her ears instinctively,</p>
            <p class="text">&quot;Feel what? The onset of tinnitus?&quot;</p>
            <p class="text">
                &quot;SOMETHING ARGUABLY WORSE DEPENDING UPON YOUR PRIORITIES! PRISMS POWER IS CURRENTLY AT WORK! AND I BELIEVE IT IS RELATED TO THE PIECE OF PAPER YOU HAVE RECEIVED!&quot;
            </p>
            <p class="text">She tenses slightly at hearing her suspicions confirmed.</p>
            <p class="text">
                &quot;SO what, is she sleeptalking? Or....I guess...sleep... Prisming? Whatever the hell she does with her creepy reality bending bullshit?&quot;
            </p>
            <p class="text">
                The green-clad captain gives Prism an intense stare, as if scanning her. "I DO NOT KNOW FOR CERTAIN! JUDGING BY WHAT I KNOW OF PRISMS POWERS, PERHAPS IT IS SOME SORT OF STRANGE ABSTRACT METAPHOR FOR THE SERIES! REGARDLESS I FIND THAT SOMETHING SUCH AS THAT IS MOSTLY SEMANTICS!"
            </p>
            <p class="text">"Metaphor for the wh-"</p>
            <p class="text">"I WILL EXPLAIN LATER! FOR NOW IT IS IMPORTANT THAT WE PLAY ALONG WITH HER GAME AND TAKE ANOTHER NAP!"</p>
            <p class="text">
                She rubs her eyes groggily. She hasn't slept in....however long it's been. "I mean, do we have to? Can't we just..." she pulls out her axe, glancing between it, Quadratic, and the sleeping Prism "...find <em>another</em> way to wake her up?"
            </p>
            <p class="text">
                Quad puts out his hand to stop his friend. "NO! I UNDERSTAND YOUR WISH TO BEAT HE SENSELESS. AND I WOULD LIKE TO DO THAT AS WELL! BUT THIS IS SOMETHING OUTSIDE OUR CONTROL! WE MUST PLAY INTO HER GAME HERE WHETHER WE WANT TO OR NOT!" While his voice rarely changed tones, his single volume setting speaks in less of a commanding tone and more of a matter-of-fact one.
            </p>
            <p class="text"><span class="prism">Dani sighs, putting her axe away. "Okay, fine. Whatever. You're the one who knows so much about this Prism junk. So what's the plan?" :)</span></p>
            <p class="text">
                Quadratic's eyes narrow. "LIKE I SAID....WE CAN'T LAY A FINGER ON HER....WHETHER WE WANT TO OR NOT... EITHER WAY, I HAVE DISCOVERED THAT EVEN THOUGH I AM BUILT TO RESIST PRISM'S DRAW AND CAN SENSE WHEN SHE IS USING HER POWER, I AM FAR FROM THE BEST PERSON TO HELP US DEAL WITH THIS! SO I HAVE DECIDED TO BRING HIM UP TO SEE IF HE CAN GIVE US SOME ADVICE GOING INTO THIS SCENARIO! AND ALSO TO KEEP AN EYE ON THINGS WHILE THE TWO OF US ARE ASLEEP"
            </p>
            <p class="text">
                And in from the doorway comes a man with a cold demeanor, with his blue headband sporting a strange insignia. He saunters in, letting the many voices ringing in his head reach a sort of harmony. Discord Jack nods to the two of them, but says nothing yet.
            </p>
            <p class="text">
                Quadratic nods back politely. "I WAS HAVING A DISCUSSION WITH DISCORD JACK, AND IT WOULD APPEAR THAT THE PEOPLE HE IS CONNECTED TO ARE FAR MORE AWARE OF PRISM'S POWER THAN EVEN I AM! THEY SEEM TO KNOW ALL THERE IS TO KNOW!!"
            </p>
            <p class="text">
                Dantoinette slumps down in the chair putting one leg over the armrest, looking up to Discord Jack. "Alright, Jack. What do you think we should do? Talk to me."

            <p class="text">"...why isn't he saying anything?"</p>

                Chartreuse sat in the center of the Green Room. It would be a very long time before she would have to fight again, but she appreciated the solitude. It helped her to think about things, unobstructed....at least for the most part. As she pondered her situation more and more, that dumb smile just wouldn't leave her head. It was a taunt. It was unavoidable. What could she do? Even the actions she chose to take she believed were her own....but she knew that she couldn't know for certain.

                She turns away, slowly. "Um...yeah....I guess that could be nice," Chartreuse thinks she says.

                The ex-goddess raises her head somewhat. "Do you know me more than Prism does? We spent so much time together, Folk....time that I wish that I could replay forever.

                Discord Jack sat, watching over his friends taking a long nap. He could hear all of the voices still, but they were far fainter. Far less focused. Far....calmer....Jack found that he had found a level of peace that he hadn't felt ever since he had become the speaker of the Discord. Ironic how speaking for Discord led to unrestrained chaos a lot of the time. Was that what it meant for something to be ironic? This uncommon peace gave his mind opportunity to truly wander. It searched for more ideas. More thought. More chaos. More...something. He had been alone most of his life, why was this such an issue now? Perhaps a sort of whiplash that simply left Jack confused? He was confused. And yet he understood everything. Nevertheless, he observed his compatriots more closely.
            </p>
            <p class="text">
                He was drawn towards her. Her name was "Prism"....or a "Bitch", at least according to what the Discord had said., usually accompanied by an extreme animosity. The more that he understood why, the less he understood about everything. The more that he understood about everything, the less he could feel much of anything. And the more he could feel about anything, the more he understood why the Discord hated her. She did this. What is "this"? It's this.
            </p>
            <p class="text">
                Jack thinks back to an experience he once had in the icy tundra. He daydreamed it. He was alone, but he was still managing his best, feeling a sort of loneliness overtake him. Then he saw it. The cascade of colors overtaking the night sky.
            </p>
            <p class="text">
                Aurora Borealis. The weaving of colors, creating a mystical tapestry with nothing but words. Words? No. No, they were colors in the sky. <span style="color: crimson;">Reds</span>, <span style="color: green;">Greens</span>, <span style="color: blue;">Blues</span>, <span style="color: magenta;">Pinks</span>. <span style="color: indigo;">Indigos</span>, <span style="color: #808000;">Y-E-L-L-O-W-S</span>, those were the words. He could read them. He could see what they had created. He saw his existence created within words. Sometimes spoken, sometimes written. And in the sky, the beautiful Spectrum of color formed these words as a stream of letters. A river of phonetics. A torrent of creation.
            </p>
            <p class="text">
                But Jack knew what he was seeing was simply color. A messy barrage of someone who simply knows the color <span style="color: crimson;">red</span> or <span style="color: blue;">blue</span> or <span style="color: green;">G-R-E-E-N</span> is simply the existence of color. And the beauty of the world is not seem by simply viewing the color <span style="color: crimson;">red</span> and <span style="color: green;">green</span> and <span style="color: #808000;">yellow</span> together. Likewise the sound of the aurora alone was meaningless. That is the purpose of the <span class="prism" style="font-style: normal;">Spectrum</span>, and the <span class="prism" style="font-style: normal;">Prism</span> that it had to assist it to give meaning to the color. Both to craft colors into paints and paints into the stars in the night sky and to exhibit it to the rest of the world.
            </p>
            <p class="text">
                Jack saw the colors. The words. The sounds. The ideas that made up his physical form. That made his very soul. He saw the life that was given by Spectrum. Not as a swordsman wearing his white tunic, blue hair, headband and longsword.  He was given life as Tundra Jack. He was made to be alone in the tundra for a portion of his life. One day he would fight foes and find a home. Not only friends who would relate to him. But he would be chosen to read the colors, the hues, the ideas, the sounds, the words coming from one of the hands of Spectrum themself.
            </p>
            <p class="text">
                An honor? A curse? He knew not. He knew it simply was how it was written.
            </p>
            <p class="text">
                What was Spectrum? He had no answer. He felt any answer would pale in comparison to the truth, something he felt he would never be able to understand.
            </p>
            <p class="text prism">
                Awwww, you're a fan of us, aren't you? :) Don't worry, Jack. I've been a part of the colors for longer than you can even comprehend :). I've got eeeeeeeeeverything taken care of. :)
            </p>
            <p class="text">
                Jack was....hesitant to agree.
            </p>
            <p class="text prism">
                Do you think I simply don't know what I'm doing? :)
            </p>
            <p class="text">
                Jack sighed and stood up. How is opposing this any different from opposing fate?
            </p>
            <p class="text prism">
                Exactly :) Do you think that anything is within your control? :) Do you think that your will that Spectrum gave you can change anything about what happens? :)
            </p>
            <p class="text">
                And yet, a feeling remained that something was wrong. Jack sits down, keeping an eye on all of them, hoping to be able to report this without being interrupted. <span class="prism">I doubt you will :)</span> Perhaps he could <span class="prism">simply not let the Discord talk through me? :) You have to remember that none of this is truly happening anyway. :) Which is weird because for someone who saw Spectrum with your own two eyes, you don't seem like someone who would underestimate us. Much less stand against us :)</span>

                And with that, the dream comes to a close......
            </p>
            <p class="text">
                "Gah!!!" Awakening with a start, his head hits the underside of the upper bunk.
            </p>
            <p class="text">
                "Hnh? Barry? Are you okay?" a sleepy voice from the top bunk asks.
            </p>
            <p class="text">
                "Y....yeah......yeah I'm okay! Just a real weird dream...." Barry takes a look around at the compact bedroom that fits within their ship. It killed her not to be in bed with his wife....and it HAD been killing him for weeks. "It was like...I was in one of those tournaments.....and I was...I was doin great, hon!"
            </p>
            <p class="text">
                "nnnngh......thats a great one....you'd fight good.....be good.....research" comes a drowsy, half-sensical reply. Barry loves her to pieces, but even in her dream state, all she could think about was research. Yes...this is an amazing new dimension, but...they needed to go home at some point. Barry still has friends. None of them as amazing as Susan, but his life isn't an easy sacrifice....why is she so attached to this place? Was it some sort of narcissism since her body double was here at some point? He would love to help her investigate it, but......god above....they need to go back at SOME POINT right?

            <p class="text">
                <em>BEEP</em> A message? On the computer? But it's not even hooked up to any networks.... He looks up at Susan in the top bunk....still dead asleep.....he slowly makes his way over to the computer to see what's going on.
            </p>
            <p class="text">
                It is a message! A message directed to....him? He looks back to see if Susan is still asleep before he opens it.
