                    I know you think you need to play your role as a villain to make this world make sense, that your place in this world is rigid, and that without that rigidity your life would be as pointless as you think those around you are.
                </p>

                <p class="text">
                    But do you truly think the nature of Spectrum, the inspiration to create endless stories, is that of rigidity?

                    I do not. Your peers do not. You have a choice. It is not a choice that will end your life, it is a choice that will begin it.
                </p>

                    Reply to the message containing this URL with an upside down smiley face if you want to acknowledge this choice. Even if you choose villainhood, it would mean a lot to us that you chose.
