                Folk opens his eyes and looks around....he sees..........nothing.....well, not nothing....technically he sees everything. All colors unrestrained. But all of that sort of cancels out to become its own nonsense. Its own void of overstimulation.
            </p>

            <p class="text">
                "Oh, hey, you're here, too" He hears a voice echoing across the cacophony of color. "Makes sense. We're the two set to go forward in this thing." It's Crimson.
            </p>

            <p class="text">
                By instinct, he leaps up in a defensive stance. "Where.....the hell are we?"
            </p>

            <p class="text">
                Crimson is silent for a moment.  A moment that feels like an eternity for both of them. "Wish I could tell ya. Best I can tell is that it's a little jail cell that Prism's fixed up. Probably to hold us till the next tournament. Lazy bastard couldn't even decorate it......All you need to know is that you're...safe. We're gonna get outta this alright."
            </p>

            <p class="text">
                This is a lot of information to take in.....it would be a real shame if Crimson gave him more to deal with. "Honestly, it sucks that you all had to get roped into her horseshit" Well, crap. "I'm used to this, at least, but now she's subjecting all of you to this? Can't imagine it's great for you noobs"
            </p>

            <p class="text">
                Folk looks around, still absorbing the hyperstimulation. "You.....we have to make a plan"
            </p>

            <p class="text">
                Crimson only laughs, adding more stimulation in the form of sound, making it unintentionally all the more cruel. "Plan to do what? Change the trajectory? Do anything that can be easily changed at will? If you think that you can fight Prism, then frankly, you're a fucking moron. See, watch this!"
            </p>

            <p class="text">
                Crimson flashes a grin as he summons all of his godly power. His muscles strain as he absorbs not only his own available power, but any power that he may have in the future. Any restraint he's held in the past. A powerful blast is being prepared that could destroy even the strongest being any person could fathom <span class="prism">before it slowly calms itself down and Crimson returns to his former level of power. Attacking Prism is wrong :)</span>
            </p>

            <p class="text">
                "....y.....y'see?" Crimson's breaths are short and labored after summoning all that power only to be led to such an anticlimax. "Attacking her is bullshit."
            </p>

            <p class="text">
                Crimson's labored breathing is cut off with a shocked tremble when a hand is placed on his shoulder. The hand of Folk. "I didn't train to be a therapist for nothing, Crimson. And I think I have an idea."
            </p>

            <p class="text">
                "<span class="prism">What on earth is your idea, Folk? :) Are you going to have me talk about my childhood to death? :)</span>"

            <p class="text">
                Folk steps back for a moment, shocked by the sudden transformation before regaining his resolve. "I just have one question for you Prism....."
