                The following is a transcription of the second Non-Canon CPUK Tournament organized by Ryan in the official Chongoshow Discord server. This tournament was broadcast over text, with only select matches streamed via voice chat. Extraneous comments and audience chatter have been left out.

                 Some additional context: Between NCCT2 and NCCT3, on April Fool's Day 2022, Prism joined the Discord with her personal account. (AKA, Ryan made a second account and roleplayed as her.) When the day ended, she did not leave.

                 Barry read over the message he'd received. No matter how hard he tried, he just couldn't read who sent it. <span class="prism">Almost as if it was impossible for him to perceive :)</span> A chance to go back? It was a nice idea, but there was no reason to go behind Susan's back. But maybe he didn't have to. <span class="prism">Maybe she could join in on the fun :)</span> Or something.....man, he must be REALLY tired, because his thoughts are getting kinda out there.
            </p>

            <p class="text">
                Barry approaches his notes and takes a look over them. While Susan had been enamored by the world they had entered into, his view was.....well......somewhat more skeptical. Even if there was no reason to be....right? <span class="prism">Right :)</span> Yeah......right.....but any scientific possibility must be explored.
            </p>

            <p class="text">
                 <span class="prism">Maybe such a scientific approach isn't the most worthwhile approach :) He should just focus on going home :)</span> .....which is easier said than done....He didn't want to break it to Susan, but the calculations on fuel consumption were a little bit off....there wasn't enough to make a return trip home. But maybe....maybe this email somehow knew that....... <span class="prism">and wanted to help :)</span>
            </p>

            <p class="text">
                This place has so many discrepancies. Susan was enamored by the discoveries we'd made, and I love her to bits for that, but every discovery only raises more questions.

One could feasibly assume that bars contain far more molecules than even my lovely Barry could count, however this is a hypothetical situation that we are establishing for the sake of this joke. Likewise, these atoms absolutely gargantuan to an extent that attempting to equate the quarks that compose them as the equivalent to our atomic structure would be not only a fool's errand, but a simply mind-bending endeavor, so for the sake of this hypothetical, I request the highest suspension of disbelief. Likewise, my parameters of "relatively low atomic weight are meant to encompass the second row of the periodic table, and while it would be quite fun to use the entirety, I would be remiss to assume that everyone knows the periodic table by heart as well as I, and creating some Frankenstein molecule such as SrF2 would be....interesting, but pointless, so for the sake of this comedic experience, let's simply use the first row!</p>
            <p class="text">So these various atoms walk into (rather float through subatomic space into) a bar (a subatomic bar.......perhaps serving electrons? Ha! A joke within a joke!) And immediately, as one might expect the Lithium and the Fluorine immediately get into a tussle of sorts! And the two Oxygen atoms seem to be quite upset with something that a nearby Carbon atom had said! Eventually, it's simply a brawl within the bar! Quite the entertaining spectacle, if you can imagine the sight of subatomic particles engaging in physical combat! Nevertheless, it would appear that the bartender approaches Neon. Who is simply there with a drink. And The bartender (likely a Neutron) asks "good heavens this has been quite the dramatic experience!!

I know I had some plans to incorporate fun arguments or whatever (specifically in an art vs the artist that created them kinda way), but I don't think I'm in a state for that atm, which I mean sincerely and directly. Fortunately, I got plenty of other stuff that should be loads of fun. </p>

This one in particular is crazy because it has a lot of characters either dead or not explicitly canon or some characters that are the same character at different times! While the battles aren't shown (mostly), as the battles happen, sometimes one of the characters of CPUK pick up Nelson :Nelson: and whoever holds Nelson can speak with the audience (you guys!!!) Currently Nelson is in possession of Doctor Order, who is (begrudgingly) getting Nelson mashed potatoes while searching for ways to fight against Prism <span class="prism">which is really cute of her :)</span>. The tournament link is pinned <span class="note">[but not included here as it includes spoilers!]</span>, and some interesting things that have happened include Dantoinette already being knocked into Loser's by Folk! Quite the shock to many! Let's continue the tournament!</p>

And that their 'evil' wasn't inherent. They weren't born...or, I guess poofed into existence? I dunno how that works with gods......anyway, I don't think that they were created just to be evil. No one is. The act of harming others isn't something people are born into doing. There are always some sorts of circumstances that lead to that. And I'm sure there's some sort of circumstance that leads Prism to being as awful of a person as she is.......does this mean it's okay? No. Never!

            <p class="text">"Right...so first question for you. Do you always feel this need to be in control?" A little bit direct, but this could be a game of give and take. Not a standard therapy session, but she had to make do.</p>

            <p class="text">"<span class="prism">Oh! Well...not always :) Sometimes you all fall right into place :)</span>" Hearing herself say the words and feeling herself attempt to rationalize why she had said them was....an interesting experience. But one that she could feel and control to a degree.</p>

            <p class="text">"Fall right into place? So you have a plan?"</p>

            <p class="text">"<span class="prism">Well.....you already asked a question....so I suppose it would be my turn, right? :)</span>"</p>


            <p class="text">---</p>


            <p class="text">Behind the "Do Not Disturb" sign sat two beings madly in love, talking amongst one another about their journeys through timelines, attempting to parse how they feel living in the timeline in which they live.</p>

            <p class="text">"So....you mentioned that Nelson had asked you something," Chartreuse asks between a light peppering of affection. "Something was on your mind......"</p>

            <p class="text">"Oh yeah, that? It was nothin'..."</p>

            <p class="text">But she noticed the discomfort immediately. "Folk...."</p>

            <p class="text">"What?"</p>

            <p class="text">"...Folk, does this have anything to do with the question that you asked me?"</p>

            <p class="text">"What question?"</p>

            <p class="text">Whether we know it or not, time is a funny thing. It binds us all together in a way that no other force can. But it's not without its sense or irony, as the same question is asked to the same person, at the same time from two different people in two different places.</p>

            <p>"Do you believe in fate?"</p>
            <p class="text">"<span class="prism">Do you believe in fate? :)</span>"</p>


            <p class="text">---</p>


            <p class="text">"Um....fate? Kind of a broad question there, but I do think that intrinsi- <span class="prism">Ah ah ah! :) I want you to really.....really think about it, Therapuppy.....I want you to really dig down in your mind for this one :)</span>" The interruptions weren't appreciated.</p>

            <p class="text">"<span class="prism">You see, if you remember, it might save you the trouble of asking a bunch of other silly unnecessary questions :)</span>" Therapuppy slowly paced around the empty room. "Well, I appreciate your kindliness on the matter, but I think an open communication between the two of us"</p>

            <p class="text">"<span class="prism">Oh, but what I have to say can't be described with words :) Well.....technically it can :) And will :) But where's the fun in me just dumping exposition? :)</span>"</p>


            <p class="text">---</p>


            <p class="text">"Um...fate? Kind of a broad question there....while I do agree with you that most of what we have is left to our own devices......I dunno...I remembered something when I was talking with Nelson......"</p>

            <p class="text">"Remembered something?"</p>

            <p class="text">"Kind of......I don't know.....but I think fate exists, like, in some kinda way....Like I was fated to be here....."</p>


            <p class="text">---</p>


            <p class="text"><em>The twilight sky was dim as it rested over the monument. Therapuppy looked around to find hundreds of other people, all spread out across the lawn, some with blankets, others with baskets of snacks. Families together all awaiting the big show. But where was Eric?</em></p>

            <p class="text"><em>Oh! There he is! He's on his way! "Hey there, girl!!!! Keepin' watch over my bag for me?" He jogged over to scratch Therapuppy behind her ears....oooooooohhhhhhh that felt good!!!!! "Sorry I was gone for so long! I was over at the bathroom, and there was a kid who took a nasty fall right there! It just so happened, I remembered seeing an emergency first aid kit in a nearby building and....well I mean, come on......" Therapuppy didn't know what he was saying, but Eric seemed happy as he reached into his bag to pull out the little orange thing with the white things inside it that he said was for all that stuff he was having trouble with!!! Awesome!!!!!</em></p>

            <p class="text"><em>He took a seat, only for a visibly discomfort to spread across his face. Oh no!!! "This.....grass is gonna make the Lasershow Spectacular a bit strange. Itchy legs and all that. Ah well....I've always wanted to come back here. Yeah, Stone Mountain has always been a memorial for......some pretty garbage things......and I didnt know that as a kid...but none of the faux patriotic garbage is what got my attention. There was just something really nice about this lasershow...It just always looked really pretty" Eric looked happy even though the grass was bad! Therapuppy was doing a good job!!!!!!! Yay!!!!!!</em></p>

            <p class="text"><em>Therapuppy excitedly rested her head into Eric's lap. "Whoa, hey now Terra! Just a heads up, there might be fireworks, but you've not had too much of a problem with those, right?" Fireworks? Oh the booms??? Those were fun!!! They were scary for a while, but Eric would scare them off with his singing!!! And eventually the booms would sing along with him!!!!! Booms were.....a little scary sometimes, but they were friends!!!!!!!!</em></p>
            <p class="text"><em>And so the show began</em></p>

            <p class="note text"><a class="note text" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YtOWeAKTlo">[BGM: Ray Lynch - Celestial Soda Pop]</a></p>

            <p class="text"><em>Therapuppy couldn't help herself but to watch the lights dance to the music....and there was something.....captivating about watching them dance......they were an assortment of <span style="color: crimson;">c</span><span style="color: green;">o</span><span style="color: blue;">l</span><span style="color: magenta;">o</span><span style="color: indigo">r</span><span style="color: #808000;">s</span>......a beautiful sequence...........a <span class="prism" style="font-style: italic;">Spectrum</span> of beauty. Something about them seemed to be outside of what any mortal being running this show could create. She saw the dancing colors as they moved in ways that couldn't be described in words. No, they could only be described in words. In <span style="color: crimson;">c</span><span style="color: green;">o</span><span style="color: blue;">l</span><span style="color: magenta;">o</span><span style="color: indigo">r</span><span style="color: #808000;">s</span>. In <span class="note">shades</span>. In <span id="ncct3p6-wiggle">movement</span>. In......affection? In love? How did these connect? They did. That's how the colors moved......she could feel her becoming something new in ways she could hardly comprehend.</em></p>

            <p class="text"><em>In what felt like the far distance, she heard Eric. "Oh....hello? Oh! Hey there! How's the leg doing? That's great! A spare blanket? Well, I don't want to impose.....okay then, I'm not gonna lie, the grass makes my legs itchy. Terra! Look, we've got some new friends! It's like I always say! Never stop being kind!"</em></p>

            <p class="text"><em>Never stop being kind. Never stop being kind. The colors...they moved and danced so beautifully as the god of all creation spoke directly to Therapuppy creating something new with the experiences she had felt in her life. Giving everything that she had new form. Never stop being kind. "Terra?" What was she feeling right now? She wanted to respond to Eric, not with a bark or a lick to the face, but with a question. Yes, Eric? And perhaps he would respond with Never Stop Being Kind. This was a truth that could not be abandoned that lived freely and truly as the lights and the colors and the words did.</em></p>

            <p class="text"><em>Amidst the colors and the words......Therapuppy saw a figure....a woman clad in a seafoam green, surrounded by time itself. Looking at her made time seem to stand still, only moving again as she moved. And as she moved, she split into multiples, each becoming its own being, engaging in their own actions. Some watching. Some dying. Some laughing. Some loving. Some simply watching. One of them approaches her. And doesn't. And does. And doesn't. And does. And doesn't. And does. And doesn't. And does. And never stops alternating. And never settling. And never stopping being kind.</em></p>

            <p class="text"><em>Of course! This is how it ended. This is how it was meant to be. This was her fate. It felt inevitable. Indescribable. Impossible to refute. And the only thing she could feel is to move towards that fate.</em></p>

            <p class="text"><em>"Terra!!!" Terra......Never stop being kind. She feels herself....floating? What was this? Ascension? Becoming higher than what she was originally intended to be?</em></p>

            <p class="text"><em>But what about Eric??????</em></p>

            <p class="text"><em>"Oh! You scared me there, Terra!" Therapuppy looks down on the two watching the light show, now joined by a small family with a young bandaged boy joining them. And she's there.....as she was before she saw the lights...she licks Eric in the face, leading to plenty of laughter between Eric and the young boy who he had assisted. Thank goodness. This ascension....this.....summoning. It wouldn't leave him alone. Therapuppy follows the spectrum of color that awakened her.</em></p>

            <p class="text"><em>She would still be there for him</em></p>
