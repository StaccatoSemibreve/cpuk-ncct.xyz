                The following is a transcription of the second Non-Canon CPUK Tournament organized by Ryan in the official Chongoshow Discord server. This tournament was broadcast over text, with only select matches streamed via voice chat. Extraneous comments and audience chatter have been left out.

                 Some additional context: Between NCCT2 and NCCT3, on April Fool's Day 2022, Prism joined the Discord with her personal account. (AKA, Ryan made a second account and roleplayed as her.) When the day ended, she did not leave.

                 Barry read over the message he'd received. No matter how hard he tried, he just couldn't read who sent it. <span class="prism">Almost as if it was impossible for him to perceive :)</span> A chance to go back? It was a nice idea, but there was no reason to go behind Susan's back. But maybe he didn't have to. <span class="prism">Maybe she could join in on the fun :)</span> Or something.....man, he must be REALLY tired, because his thoughts are getting kinda out there.

            <p class="text">
                Barry approaches his notes and takes a look over them. While Susan had been enamored by the world they had entered into, his view was.....well......somewhat more skeptical. Even if there was no reason to be....right? <span class="prism">Right :)</span> Yeah......right.....but any scientific possibility must be explored.
            </p>

            <p class="text">
                 <span class="prism">Maybe such a scientific approach isn't the most worthwhile approach :) He should just focus on going home :)</span> .....which is easier said than done....He didn't want to break it to Susan, but the calculations on fuel consumption were a little bit off....there wasn't enough to make a return trip home. But maybe....maybe this email somehow knew that....... <span class="prism">and wanted to help :)</span>

            <p class="text">
                This place has so many discrepancies. Susan was enamored by the discoveries we'd made, and I love her to bits for that, but every discovery only raises more questions.

One could feasibly assume that bars contain far more molecules than even my lovely Barry could count, however this is a hypothetical situation that we are establishing for the sake of this joke. Likewise, these atoms absolutely gargantuan to an extent that attempting to equate the quarks that compose them as the equivalent to our atomic structure would be not only a fool's errand, but a simply mind-bending endeavor, so for the sake of this hypothetical, I request the highest suspension of disbelief. Likewise, my parameters of "relatively low atomic weight are meant to encompass the second row of the periodic table, and while it would be quite fun to use the entirety, I would be remiss to assume that everyone knows the periodic table by heart as well as I, and creating some Frankenstein molecule such as SrF2 would be....interesting, but pointless, so for the sake of this comedic experience, let's simply use the first row!</p>
            <p class="text">So these various atoms walk into (rather float through subatomic space into) a bar (a subatomic bar.......perhaps serving electrons? Ha! A joke within a joke!) And immediately, as one might expect the Lithium and the Fluorine immediately get into a tussle of sorts! And the two Oxygen atoms seem to be quite upset with something that a nearby Carbon atom had said! Eventually, it's simply a brawl within the bar! Quite the entertaining spectacle, if you can imagine the sight of subatomic particles engaging in physical combat! Nevertheless, it would appear that the bartender approaches Neon. Who is simply there with a drink. And The bartender (likely a Neutron) asks "good heavens this has been quite the dramatic experience!!
