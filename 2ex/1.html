                Dani looks down at the slip of paper. She&#39;s starting to feel the bags under her eyes as the url burned into her skull. &quot;<a href="https://challonge.com/DreamKerfuffle2">http://challonge.com/DreamKerfuffle2</a> &quot;..... what in the hell does it mean. She pulled out her phone and entered the url again. The page ended up loading <span class="prism">absolutely nothing :)</span>! What the hell did it mean? And what was Prism doing in her dreams? Would it even be a good idea to sleep?

            <p class="text">
                &quot;DANTOINETTE!&quot; came a sudden shout so loud, it felt like a light turned on in her brain. <span class="prism">I just think all this clicking is tedious :)</span> <span class="note">[note: all dialogue up to this point was contained in spoiler tags]</span> Well, at least sleep isn&#39;t going to take her slowly with Captain Quadratic entering the room. &quot;DID YOU FEEL THAT JUST NOW?&quot;
            </p>
            <p class="text">Dani shakes her head, covering one of her ears instinctively,</p>
            <p class="text">&quot;Feel what? The onset of tinnitus?&quot;</p>
            <p class="text">
                &quot;SOMETHING ARGUABLY WORSE DEPENDING UPON YOUR PRIORITIES! PRISMS POWER IS CURRENTLY AT WORK! AND I BELIEVE IT IS RELATED TO THE PIECE OF PAPER YOU HAVE RECEIVED!&quot;
            </p>
            <p class="text">She tenses slightly at hearing her suspicions confirmed.</p>
            <p class="text">
                &quot;SO what, is she sleeptalking? Or....I guess...sleep... Prisming? Whatever the hell she does with her creepy reality bending bullshit?&quot;
            </p>
            <p class="text">
                The green-clad captain gives Prism an intense stare, as if scanning her. "I DO NOT KNOW FOR CERTAIN! JUDGING BY WHAT I KNOW OF PRISMS POWERS, PERHAPS IT IS SOME SORT OF STRANGE ABSTRACT METAPHOR FOR THE SERIES! REGARDLESS I FIND THAT SOMETHING SUCH AS THAT IS MOSTLY SEMANTICS!"
            </p>
            <p class="text">"Metaphor for the wh-"</p>
            <p class="text">"I WILL EXPLAIN LATER! FOR NOW IT IS IMPORTANT THAT WE PLAY ALONG WITH HER GAME AND TAKE ANOTHER NAP!"</p>
            <p class="text">
                She rubs her eyes groggily. She hasn't slept in....however long it's been. "I mean, do we have to? Can't we just..." she pulls out her axe, glancing between it, Quadratic, and the sleeping Prism "...find <em>another</em> way to wake her up?"
            </p>
            <p class="text">
                Quad puts out his hand to stop his friend. "NO! I UNDERSTAND YOUR WISH TO BEAT HE SENSELESS. AND I WOULD LIKE TO DO THAT AS WELL! BUT THIS IS SOMETHING OUTSIDE OUR CONTROL! WE MUST PLAY INTO HER GAME HERE WHETHER WE WANT TO OR NOT!" While his voice rarely changed tones, his single volume setting speaks in less of a commanding tone and more of a matter-of-fact one.
            </p>
            <p class="text"><span class="prism">Dani sighs, putting her axe away. "Okay, fine. Whatever. You're the one who knows so much about this Prism junk. So what's the plan?" :)</span></p>
            <p class="text">
                Quadratic's eyes narrow. "LIKE I SAID....WE CAN'T LAY A FINGER ON HER....WHETHER WE WANT TO OR NOT... EITHER WAY, I HAVE DISCOVERED THAT EVEN THOUGH I AM BUILT TO RESIST PRISM'S DRAW AND CAN SENSE WHEN SHE IS USING HER POWER, I AM FAR FROM THE BEST PERSON TO HELP US DEAL WITH THIS! SO I HAVE DECIDED TO BRING HIM UP TO SEE IF HE CAN GIVE US SOME ADVICE GOING INTO THIS SCENARIO! AND ALSO TO KEEP AN EYE ON THINGS WHILE THE TWO OF US ARE ASLEEP"
            </p>
            <p class="text">
                And in from the doorway comes a man with a cold demeanor, with his blue headband sporting a strange insignia. He saunters in, letting the many voices ringing in his head reach a sort of harmony. Discord Jack nods to the two of them, but says nothing yet.
            </p>
            <p class="text">
                Quadratic nods back politely. "I WAS HAVING A DISCUSSION WITH DISCORD JACK, AND IT WOULD APPEAR THAT THE PEOPLE HE IS CONNECTED TO ARE FAR MORE AWARE OF PRISM'S POWER THAN EVEN I AM! THEY SEEM TO KNOW ALL THERE IS TO KNOW!!"
            </p>
            <p class="text">
                Dantoinette slumps down in the chair putting one leg over the armrest, looking up to Discord Jack. "Alright, Jack. What do you think we should do? Talk to me."

            <p class="text">"...why isn't he saying anything?"</p>

        <p class="ryan text">He won't accept it</p>
        <p class="ryan text">I hc Prism's "mind control" (that's only really been used once) works far different than your standard mind control.</p>
        <p class="ryan text">Most mind control you see is either wiping the mind completely or making servitude associated with a positive emotion so the person loves serving the controller.</p>
        <p class="ryan text">Prism's is....worse</p>
        <p class="ryan text">Prism's fills you with immense guilt of her disappointment if you go against what she wishes</p>
        <p class="ryan text">Even if you hate her, the guilt is heart-wrenching</p>
        <p class="ryan text">Anyway that's just me being violent :)</p>
        <p class="ryan">Not even so much like a "oh I made her feel bad"</p>
        <p class="ryan text">I should clarify</p>
        <p class="ryan text">"Guilt" isn't quite the right word because it's a more emotional response</p>
        <p class="ryan text">Not following through gives you the feeling that you feel when you knew you said you were going to do something incredibly important. And you didnt</p>
        <p class="ryan very">Her mind control isn't emptiness. It's not happiness. It's obligation.</p>
