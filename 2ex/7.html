                Discord Jack sat, watching over his friends taking a long nap. He could hear all of the voices still, but they were far fainter. Far less focused. Far....calmer....Jack found that he had found a level of peace that he hadn't felt ever since he had become the speaker of the Discord. Ironic how speaking for Discord led to unrestrained chaos a lot of the time. Was that what it meant for something to be ironic? This uncommon peace gave his mind opportunity to truly wander. It searched for more ideas. More thought. More chaos. More...something. He had been alone most of his life, why was this such an issue now? Perhaps a sort of whiplash that simply left Jack confused? He was confused. And yet he understood everything. Nevertheless, he observed his compatriots more closely.
            </p>
            <p class="text">
                He was drawn towards her. Her name was "Prism"....or a "Bitch", at least according to what the Discord had said., usually accompanied by an extreme animosity. The more that he understood why, the less he understood about everything. The more that he understood about everything, the less he could feel much of anything. And the more he could feel about anything, the more he understood why the Discord hated her. She did this. What is "this"? It's this.
            </p>
            <p class="text">
                Jack thinks back to an experience he once had in the icy tundra. He daydreamed it. He was alone, but he was still managing his best, feeling a sort of loneliness overtake him. Then he saw it. The cascade of colors overtaking the night sky.
            </p>
            <p class="text">
                Aurora Borealis. The weaving of colors, creating a mystical tapestry with nothing but words. Words? No. No, they were colors in the sky. Reds, Greens, Blues, Pinks. Indigos, Y-E-L-L-O-W-S, those were the words. He could read them. He could see what they had created. He saw his existence created within words. Sometimes spoken, sometimes written. And in the sky, the beautiful Spectrum of color formed these words as a stream of letters. A river of phonetics. A torrent of creation.
            </p>
            <p class="text">
                But Jack knew what he was seeing was simply color. A messy barrage of someone who simply knows the color red or blue or G-R-E-E-N is simply the existence of color. And the beauty of the world is not seem by simply viewing the color red and green and yellow together. Likewise the sound of the aurora alone was meaningless. That is the purpose of the Spectrum, and the Prism that it had to assist it to give meaning to the color. Both to craft colors into paints and paints into the stars in the night sky and to exhibit it to the rest of the world.
            </p>
            <p class="text">
                Jack saw the colors. The words. The sounds. The ideas that made up his physical form. That made his very soul. He saw the life that was given by Spectrum. Not as a swordsman wearing his white tunic, blue hair, headband and longsword.  He was given life as Tundra Jack. He was made to be alone in the tundra for a portion of his life. One day he would fight foes and find a home. Not only friends who would relate to him. But he would be chosen to read the colors, the hues, the ideas, the sounds, the words coming from one of the hands of Spectrum themself.
            </p>
            <p class="text">
                An honor? A curse? He knew not. He knew it simply was how it was written.
            </p>
            <p class="text">
                What was Spectrum? He had no answer. He felt any answer would pale in comparison to the truth, something he felt he would never be able to understand.
            </p>
            <p class="text prism">
                Awwww, you're a fan of us, aren't you? :) Don't worry, Jack. I've been a part of the colors for longer than you can even comprehend :). I've got eeeeeeeeeverything taken care of. :)
            </p>
            <p class="text">
                Jack was....hesitant to agree.
            </p>
            <p class="text prism">
                Do you think I simply don't know what I'm doing? :)
            </p>
            <p class="text">
                Jack sighed and stood up. How is opposing this any different from opposing fate?
            </p>
            <p class="text prism">
                Exactly :) Do you think that anything is within your control? :) Do you think that your will that Spectrum gave you can change anything about what happens? :)
            </p>
            <p class="text">
                And yet, a feeling remained that something was wrong. Jack sits down, keeping an eye on all of them, hoping to be able to report this without being interrupted. <span class="prism">I doubt you will :)</span> Perhaps he could <span class="prism">simply not let the Discord talk through me? :) You have to remember that none of this is truly happening anyway. :) Which is weird because for someone who saw Spectrum with your own two eyes, you don't seem like someone who would underestimate us. Much less stand against us :)</span>

            <p class="text">
                The more he felt anything, the more he understood the Discord's animosity to this Bitch.

        <p class="ryan">On one hand that whole deal is still not 100% canon (seeing how I fuckin.....just kinda went crazy went stupid on this prose), but</p>

        <p class="ryan">I'll say that wasn't intentional, but that being his focus in that moment becoming his spring colors is a very fun coincidence</p>
        <p class="ryan text">While I hold true that it's open to interpretation depending on who reads it the colors themselves are not what is important. It's how he perceives them.</p>

        <p class="ryan">Again the nature of Spectrum is 10000000% Death Of The Author in terms of interpretations</p>

        <p class="text">
            And with that, the dream comes to a close......
        </p>
        <p class="text">
            "Gah!!!" Awakening with a start, his head hits the underside of the upper bunk.
        </p>
        <p class="text">
            "Hnh? Barry? Are you okay?" a sleepy voice from the top bunk asks.
        </p>
        <p class="text">
            "Y....yeah......yeah I'm okay! Just a real weird dream...." Barry takes a look around at the compact bedroom that fits within their ship. It killed her not to be in bed with his wife....and it HAD been killing him for weeks. "It was like...I was in one of those tournaments.....and I was...I was doin great, hon!"
        </p>
        <p class="text">
            "nnnngh......thats a great one....you'd fight good.....be good.....research" comes a drowsy, half-sensical reply. Barry loves her to pieces, but even in her dream state, all she could think about was research. Yes...this is an amazing new dimension, but...they needed to go home at some point. Barry still has friends. None of them as amazing as Susan, but his life isn't an easy sacrifice....why is she so attached to this place? Was it some sort of narcissism since her body double was here at some point? He would love to help her investigate it, but......god above....they need to go back at SOME POINT right?
        </p>
        <p class="text">
             <em>BEEP</em> A message? On the computer? But it's not even hooked up to any networks.... He looks up at Susan in the top bunk....still dead asleep.....he slowly makes his way over to the computer to see what's going on.
        </p>
        <p class="text">
            It is a message! A message directed to....him? He looks back to see if Susan is still asleep before he opens it.
