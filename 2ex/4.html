                Chartreuse sat in the center of the Green Room. It would be a very long time before she would have to fight again, but she appreciated the solitude. It helped her to think about things, unobstructed....at least for the most part. As she pondered her situation more and more, that dumb smile just wouldn't leave her head. It was a taunt. It was unavoidable. What could she do? Even the actions she chose to take she believed were her own....but she knew that she couldn't know for certain.

                Her canine boyfriend could easily sense the discomfort as it seeped through her, covering her like a prismatic molasses, trapping her. Leaving her helpless.

                She turns away, slowly. "Um...yeah....I guess that could be nice," Chartreuse thinks she says.

                The ex-goddess raises her head somewhat. "Do you know me more than Prism does? We spent so much time together, Folk....time that I wish that I could replay forever.

I want to know every single part of you not only so that I can adore it, but because I want to know how I can make your life the best that it can be."
